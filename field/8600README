snapcopy  - This program will request snapshot file status from the frontend.
	    Any valid snapshot files will then be copied from the frontend
	    and placed in the specified directory in the Ultrix-32 file
	    system. The snapshot files on the frontend will then be
	    invalidated. This program can be manually invoked or run from the
	    /etc/rc.local file (site specific startup commands). The program
	    can be run anytime, single or multiuser mode.

	    The snapshot file(s) that are copied to the Ultrix-32 file system 
	    will be given the name(s):

			hr:min:sec-snap1.dat

				 or

			hr:min:sec-snap2.dat


	    The /etc/rc.local file has the correct entry to envoke the
	    'snapcopy' program when the system boots to multiuser mode.
	    NOTE that this entry in the /etc/rc.local file is commented
	    out and will NOT work until the comment characters ( # ) are
	    removed. Ask the system manager to do this.

	    There may be time when you want to manually envoke the snapcopy 
	    program, for example if the system is only to be booted to
	    single user mode. To invoke the program manually you must have 
	    root (superuser) privalages and the /usr file-system must be
	    mounted. Type the command:

			/etc/snapcopy directory

	    Where 'directory' is the full path name to the directory where 
	    you want the snapshot files to be copied to, for example

			/etc/snapcopy /usr/field

	    Will copy any valid snapshot files to the /usr/field directory.

showsnap - This program is a limited functionality version of the VSR
	    program that runs under VMS. This program will provide a bit
	    to text translation of the snapshot files. Translation of the
	    visability points is not supported in this version. The program
	    can be run at any time, single or multiuser mode.

	    You may install the program where ever you wish, it may be 
	    handy to have it where you will be copying the snapshot files
	    to. To use it, you must redirect the input to be one of the 
	    files created by the 'snapcopy' program, for example:


	    Assume you have left the 'showsnap' program in /usr/field 
	    and the snapshot files are being copied into /usr/adm/snap
	    you use the following command:

		showsnap < /usr/adm/snap/01:28:34-snap1.dat

	    You may also redirect the output to a file:

		showsnap < /usr/adm/snap/13:43:01-snap2.dat >file-name

	    To then get a line printer copy of the file you would use:

		lpr file-name

	    You may also 'pipe' the output directly to the printer:

		snowsnap < /usr/adm/snap/13:43:01-snap2.dat | lpr

	    If you are using a video terminal it may be more convienent
	    to use 'more' to keep the data from scrolling off the screen:

		showsnap < /usr/adm/snap/01:28:34-snap1.dat | more

				or

		showsnap < /usr/adm/snap/13:43:01-snap2.dat >file-name
		more file-name
