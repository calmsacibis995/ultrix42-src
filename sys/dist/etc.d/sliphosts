#
# /etc/sliphosts contains information about Serial Line Internet Protocol 
# hosts. Hosts come in numerous types but all are considered masters
# or slaves depending on what is present in this file. Masters 
# initiate the connection as:
# 
#	/usr/new/slattach host
#
# where host is the name to search for in /etc/hosts (the destination
# found is eventually passed to an /etc/ifconfig). 
# Slaves use /usr/new/slattach as their login shell (shell field of /etc/passwd)
# and the login name is matched against the host field below.
#
# Slip requires a special line discipline in the kernel. To build
# slip into a binary system, add the line "pseudo-device  sl" to your
# configuration file, remove your machine directory, and rebuild
# the kernel (config MACHINE; make depend; make vmunix). 
#
# The fields describing each connection are:
#
# host destination gateway netmask speed tty modemtype phonenum logininfo
# 
# Host is used to match the entry in this file.
#
# Destination is used an argument to ifconfig
#
# Gateway is usually the hostname of the system although it may be 
# changed for specific routing cases. 
#
# Netmask depends on your network and is passed to
# /etc/ifconfig. Speed is the speed at which the connection is to be
# run (this may be "any" for slaves and the speed of the line will
# not be modified). 
#
# The device is the line to use for this connection
# (for masters this is the outgoing line to use and for slave /dev/tty
# is usually specified). 
#
# Modemtype is specified as the type of modem
# to use (name must match an entry in /etc/acucap or "hw" for hardwired
# connections - Master only). 
#
# Phonenum is present if modemtype is not "hw" 
# and is the phone number to use (Master only). 
#
# Logininfo is UUCP like info 
# needed to negotiate the SLIP login at the remote host (Master only).
#
# Thus a sample Master might be:
#
# decvax decvax.dec.com test.fun netmask 19200 /dev/ttyd0 hayes-V 5-5555 ogin: Stest ssword: guess 
#
# (Notice "decvax.dec.com", "test.fun", "netmask" must be found in /etc/hosts,
# /etc/networks or resolved by a name server as these are passed 
# to /etc/ifconfig).
#

#
cyclops	cyclops dec7.dec.com	255.255.255.0	19200	/dev/tty01 hw "" \r\c ogin: dec7 ssword: dec7
#
# What slave cyclops would have in its /etc/sliphosts file to allow the
# connection. In addition, the dec7 would need to be present in the
# password file with the shell set to "/usr/new/slattach"
#
dec7	dec7.dec.com cyclops	255.255.255.0	any	/dev/tty
