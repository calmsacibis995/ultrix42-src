The ULTRIX Operating System provides the netsetup command to help
you establish a network or add your system to an existing network.

For networks to function smoothly they must be carefully planned.
Before setting up a network or adding your system to an existing
network you must know the following information:

	Your network number

	Your host number

	Whether your broadcast uses all 1s or all 0s

	Whether your network uses subnet routing,
	and how many bits it uses to specify the
	subnet, if it does

If you are connecting to an existing network, see the network
administrator for the information that you need.  

If you are establishing a network for the first time, read the
Introduction to Networking and Distributed System Services for basic
information on networking concepts, or see your network manager for
help.  For information on using the netsetup command, see the Guide
to System and Network Setup.
