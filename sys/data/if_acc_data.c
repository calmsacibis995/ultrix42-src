/*
 * "Lower half" of IMP interface driver.
 *
 * Each IMP interface is handled by a common module which handles
 * the IMP-host protocol and a hardware driver which manages the
 * hardware specific details of talking with the IMP.
 *
 * The hardware portion of the IMP driver handles DMA and related
 * management of UNIBUS resources.  The IMP protocol module interprets
 * contents of these messages and "controls" the actions of the
 * hardware module during IMP resets, but not, for instance, during
 * UNIBUS resets.
 *
 * The two modules are coupled at "attach time", and ever after,
 * through the imp interface structure.  Higher level protocols,
 * e.g. IP, interact with the IMP driver, rather than the ACC.
