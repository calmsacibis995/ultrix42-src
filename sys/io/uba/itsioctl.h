 * ITEX/FG101 Series 100 frame buffer ioctl structures/definitions
 *
 *  2-Dec-86 - lp/rsp (Larry Palmer/Ricky Palmer)
 *
 *	Created prototype frame buffer driver.
 */

/*
 *	This  driver  provides user level programs with the ability to
 *	read  and  write  any  of  the	frame  buffer registers.  This
 *	capability  is	provided  via  the  ITSMAP  ioctl  request and
 *	subsequent  user  direct  access  to  the  registers and frame
 *	memory.   The  driver  initializes  the  scanner hardware in a
 *	default  state.   The same initialization is possible by using
 *	the  registers	directly.  Note that DMA is NOT possible since
 *	the board does not support local DMA transfers to another QBUS
 *	device.   The  documentation  provided	by  Imaging Technology
 *	should	be  consulted  for further details involving the frame
 *	buffer	hardware/software.   This  driver  is  provided  as  a
 *	service  to  Digital  Ultrix  customers  who  would  like  the
 *	capability to combine the frame buffer hardware with their GPX
 *	system	in  order  to  create  digital	images from a standard
 *	television  camera hookup.  The driver is provided "as-is" and
 *	is  NOT  supported  under any Digital agreements or contracts.
 *	Electronic   mail   concerning	the  driver  may  be  sent  to
 *	decvax!rsp  or	decvax!lp  but	there  is  no guarantee of any
 *	response or support.
 *
 *	This driver assumes the following configuration:
 *
 *		FG101 at 173000
 *		Memory Map @ 0x30200000
 *
 *	The availble ioctl requests for this driver are:
 *
 *	(1) ITSMAP - maps the frame buffer into user space.
 *	(2) ITSGRABIT - starts the frame buffer grabbing frames (30/sec).
 *	(3) ITSFREEZE - freezes a frame.
 *	(4) ITSZOOM - initiates a zoom;subsequent calls cycle through.
