.SH Description
This is a generic UNIBUS storage module disk driver.
It is specifically designed to work with the Emulex SC-21 controller.
It can be easily
adapted to other controllers (although bootstrapping will
not necessarily be directly possible.)
.PP
Files with minor device numbers 0 through 7 refer to various portions
of drive 0;
minor devices 8 through 15 refer to drive 1, etc.
The standard device names begin with ``up'' followed by
the drive number and then a letter a-h for partitions 0-7 respectively.
The character ? stands here for a drive number in the range 0-7.
.PP
The block files access the disk via the system's normal
buffering mechanism and may be read and written without regard to
physical disk records.  There is also a `raw' interface
which provides for direct transmission between the disk
and the user's read or write buffer.
A single read or write call results in exactly one I/O operation
and therefore raw I/O is considerably more efficient when
many words are transmitted.  The names of the raw files
conventionally begin with an extra `r.'
.PP
In raw I/O counts should be a multiple of 512 bytes (a disk sector).
Likewise
.I seek
calls should specify a multiple of 512 bytes.
.SS Disk Support
The driver interrogates the controller's holding register
to determine the type of drive attached.  The driver recognizes
four different drives: AMPEX 9300, CDC 9766, AMPEX Capricorn,
and FUJITSU 160.
The origin and size of the pseudo-disks on each drive are
as follows:

It is unwise for all of these files to be present in one installation,
since there is overlap in addresses and protection becomes
a sticky matter.
The up?a partition is normally used for the root file system,
the up?b partition as a paging area,
and the up?c partition for pack-pack copying (it maps the entire disk).
On 160M drives the up?g partition maps the rest of the pack.
On other drives both up?g and up?h are used to map the
remaining cylinders.
.SH Restrictions
In raw I/O
.PN read
and
.MS write 2
truncate file offsets to 512-byte block boundaries,
and
.PN write
scribbles on the tail of incomplete blocks.
Thus,
in programs that are likely to access raw devices,
.PN read , 
.PN write
and
.MS lseek 2
should always deal in 512-byte multiples.
.SH Diagnostics
\fBup%d%c: hard error sn%d cs2=%b er1=%b er2=%b\fR.
.br
An unrecoverable
error occurred during transfer of the specified sector in the specified
disk partition.
The contents of the cs2, er1 and er2 registers are printed
in octal and symbolically with bits decoded.
The error was either unrecoverable, or a large number of retry attempts
(including offset positioning and drive recalibration) could not
recover the error.
.PP
\fBup%d: write locked\fR.
.br
The write protect switch was set on the drive
when a write was attempted.  The write operation is not recoverable.
.PP
\fBup%d: not ready\fR.
.br
The drive was spun down or off line when it was
accessed.  The i/o operation is not recoverable.
.PP
\fBup%d: not ready (flakey)\fR.
.br
The drive was not ready, but after
printing the message about being not ready (which takes a fraction
of a second) was ready.  The operation is recovered if no further
errors occur.
.PP
\fBup%d%c: soft ecc sn%d\fR.
.br
A recoverable ECC error occurred on the
specified sector of the specified disk partition.
This happens normally
a few times a week. If it happens more frequently than
this the sectors where the errors are occurring should be checked to see
if certain cylinders on the pack, spots on the carriage of the drive
or heads are indicated.
.PP
\fBsc%d: lost interrupt\fR.
.br
A timer watching the controller detecting
no interrupt for an extended period while an operation was outstanding.
This indicates a hardware or software failure.  There is currently a
hardware/software problem with spinning down drives while they are
being accessed which causes this error to occur.
The error causes a UNIBUS reset, and retry of the pending operations.
If the controller continues to lose interrupts, this error will recur
a few seconds later.
