rb \- IDC/RL02 disk interface

.SH Description
.NXS "rb interface" "RL02 disk interface"
.NXS "rb interface" "IDC disk interface"
.NXR "RL02 disk interface"
.NXR "IDC disk interface"
Files with minor device numbers 0 through 7 refer to various portions
of drive 0;
minor devices 8 through 15 refer to drive 1, and so forth.
The standard device names begin with
.PN rb
followed by
the drive number and then a letter, a through 
h, for partitions 0 through 7.
The question mark (?) character
stands here for a drive number in the range 0 through 7.
.PP
The block files access the disk by the system's normal
buffering mechanism and can be read and written, without regard to
physical disk records.
There is also a raw interface,
which provides for direct transmission between the disk
and the user's read or write buffer.
A single read or write call results in exactly one I/O operation.
Therefore, raw I/O is considerably more efficient when
many words are transmitted.  The names of the raw files
conventionally begin with an additional letter r, for example,
.PN rrx2c .
.PP
Although RL02 disks have 256-byte sectors,
the driver emulates 512-byte sectors.
Raw I/O counts should be multiples of 512 bytes (a normal disk sector).
In the same way,
.PN seek
calls should specify a multiple of 512 bytes.
.PP
The origin and size (in 512-byte sectors) of the
pseudodisks on each drive are as follows:
.PP
.nf
.ta .5i +\w'000000    'u +\w'000000    'u +\w'000000	'u
RL02 partitions:
.sp 6p
	disk	start	length	cyl
.sp 6p
	rb?a	0	15884	0-397
	rb?b	15884	4520	398-510
	rb?c	0	20480	0-511
	rb?d	15884	4520	398-510
	rb?g	0	20480	0-511

.SH Restrictions
In raw I/O, 
.PN read
and
.PN write 
functions truncate file offsets to 512-byte block boundaries;
.PN write
overwrites the tail of incomplete blocks.
Thus, in programs that are likely to access raw devices, 
.MS read 2 ,
.MS write 2 ,
and
.MS lseek 2
should always deal in 512-byte multiples.
.SH Diagnostics
The following messages can appear at the console:
.PP
.B "rb%%d%c: hard error sn%d"
.br
An unrecoverable error occurred during transfer of the
specified sector of the specified disk partition.
Either the error was unrecoverable,
or a large number of retry attempts
(including offset positioning and drive recalibration)
could not recover the error.
Additional register information can be gathered from the system
error log file, 
\f(CW/usr/adm/syserr/syserr.\fI<hostname>\fR.
.PP
.B "rb%d: write protected"
.br
The write protect switch was set on the drive when
a write was attempted.
The write operation is not recoverable.
.PP
.B "idc%d: lost interrupt"
.br
A timer watching the controller detected no interrupt for
an extended period while an operation was outstanding.
This indicates a hardware or software failure.
The error causes a UNIBUS reset and retry of the pending operations.
If the controller continues to lose interrupts, this error will recur
a few seconds later.
