.SH Description
Section 4 describes the special files, related driver functions,
and networking support available in the system.
In this part of the manual, the Syntax heading of
each configurable device gives a sample specification
for use in constructing a system description for the
.MS config 8
program.
The Diagnostics heading lists messages that may appear on the console
and in the system error log 
file 
.PN /usr/adm/syserr/syserr.<hostname>
due to errors in device operation.
.PP
This section contains descriptions of both 
configurable devices, 4 entries,
and network-related device information,
4n, 4p, and 4f entries.
The networking support is introduced in
.MS intro 4n .
Software support for these devices comes in two forms.
A hardware device may be supported with a character or block
``device driver'',
or it may be used within the networking subsystem and have a
``network interface driver''.
.PP
There are some devices that have fixed input/output space
CSR addresses and
interrupt vector addresses. There are no address switches or jumpers
that need to be set up by the customer or Field Service.
