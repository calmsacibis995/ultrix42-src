.SH Syntax
.B #include <sys/acct.h>
.SH Description
.NXR "accounting file" "format"
.NXAM "acct system call" "acct file"
The 
.MS acct 2
system call makes entries in an accounting file
for each process that terminates.
The accounting file is a sequence of entries whose layout,
as defined by the include file, is:
.EX 0
struct  acct
{
        char    ac_comm[10];   /* Accounting command name */
        float   ac_utime;      /* Accounting user time */
        float   ac_stime;      /* Accounting system time */
        float   ac_etime;      /* Accounting elapsed time */
        time_t  ac_btime;      /* Beginning time */
        short   ac_uid;        /* Accounting user ID */
        short   ac_gid;        /* Accounting group ID */
        float   ac_mem;        /* average memory usage */
        float   ac_io;         /* number of disk IO blocks */
        dev_t   ac_tty;        /* control typewriter */
        char    ac_flag;       /* Accounting flag */
};

#define AFORK   0001    /* has executed fork, but no exec */
#define ASU     0002    /* used super-user privileges */
#define ACOMPAT 0004    /* used compatibility mode */
#define ACORE   0010    /* dumped core */
#define AXSIG   0020    /* killed by a signal */

#ifdef KERNEL
struct  acct    acctbuf;
struct  inode   *acctp;
#endif
.EE
If the process does an 
.MS execve 2 ,
the first 10 characters of the file name appear in
.I ac_comm.
The accounting flag contains bits indicating whether 
.MS execve 2
was ever accomplished and whether the process ever had 
superuser privileges.
