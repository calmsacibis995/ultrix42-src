.SH Description
.NXR "time subroutine (standard C)"
.NXR "ftime subroutine"
.NXR "time" "getting"
.NXR "date" "getting"
The
.PN time
subroutine
returns the time since 00:00:00 GMT, Jan. 1, 1970, measured
in seconds.
.PP
If
.I tloc
is nonnull,
the return value is also stored in the
place to which
.I tloc
points.
.PP
The
.PN ftime
entry fills in a structure pointed to by its argument,
as defined by <sys/timeb.h>:
.EX

struct timeb
{
        time_t   time;
        unsigned short millitm;
        short    timezone;
        short    dstflag;
};

.EE
.PP
The structure contains the time since the epoch in seconds,
up to 1000 milliseconds of more-precise interval,
the local time zone
(measured in minutes of time westward from Greenwich),
and a flag that, if nonzero, indicates that
Daylight Saving time applies locally
during the appropriate part of the year.
