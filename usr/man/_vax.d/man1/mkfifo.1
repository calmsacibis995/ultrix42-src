.I filename ...
.SH Description
The 
.PN mkfifo
command creates the `fifo special files' named by 
its operand list.  The operands are taken sequentially, in the order 
specified, and each `fifo special file' is either completed 
or, in the case of an error or signal, not created at all. Unless 
interrupted, 
.PN mkfifo 
will attempt to create all files specified.
Error messages are written to standard error.
.PP
Each `fifo file' is created with a mode of 666, read and write 
privileges for the user, group and other. The mode is modified by 
clearing those bits set in the process's file mode creation mask. See
.MS umask 2
for more information.
