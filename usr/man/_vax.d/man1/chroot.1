.SH Description
.NXr "root directory change"
.NXM "root directory" "chroot command"
The 
.PN chroot
command is executed
relative to the

in path names is changed for a command and any of its children to
.IR newroot .

.IR newroot .

.PP
Use extreme caution when referencing special files
in the new root file system.
