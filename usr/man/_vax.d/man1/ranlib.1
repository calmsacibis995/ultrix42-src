.SH Description
.NXR "archive file" "reconstructing"
.NXA "ranlib command" "lorder command"
.NXA "ar program" "ranlib command"
.NXR "ranlib command"
The
.PN ranlib
command
converts each
.I archive
to a form which the loader can load more rapidly.
The
.PN ranlib
command
does this by adding a table of contents called _.SYMDEF
to the beginning of the archive.
the
.PN ranlib
command uses 
.MS ar 1
to reconstruct the archive, so that sufficient temporary file space must
be available in the file system which contains the current directory.
.SH Restrictions
Because generation of a library by
.PN ar
and randomization of the library by
.PN ranlib
are separate processes, phase errors are possible.  The loader,
.PN ld ,
warns when the modification date of a library is more recent than the
creation date of its dictionary;  but this means that you get the
warning even if you only copy the library.
