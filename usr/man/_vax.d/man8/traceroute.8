.SH Description
.NXR "traceroute command"
The Internet is a large and complex aggregation of
network hardware connected together by gateways.
Tracking the route one's packets follow (or finding the miscreant
gateway that is discarding your packets) can be difficult.
The 
.PN traceroute
command uses the IP protocol `time to live' field and attempts to elicit an
ICMP TIME_EXCEEDED response from each gateway along the path to a particular
host.
.PP
The only mandatory parameter is the destination host name or IP number.
The default probe datagram length is 38 bytes, but this may be increased
by specifying a packet size (in bytes) after the destination host
name.
.PP
This program attempts to trace the route an IP packet would follow to some
internet host by launching UDP probe
packets with a small ttl (time to live) then listening for an
ICMP "time exceeded" reply from a gateway.  We start our probes
with a ttl of one and increase by one until we get an ICMP "port
unreachable" (which means we got to "host") or hit a max (which
defaults to 30 hops and can be changed with the \-m flag).  Three
probes (which can be changed with the \-q flag) are sent at each 
ttl setting and a
line is printed showing the ttl, address of the gateway and
round trip time of each probe.  If the probe answers come from
different gateways, the address of each responding system will
be printed.  If there is no response within a 3 second timeout
interval (which can be changed with the \-w flag), a "*" is printed for that
probe.
.PP
We do not want the destination
host to process the UDP probe packets so the destination port is set to an
unlikely value.  The destination port value can be changed with the \-p flag,
if necessary.
.SH Options
Additional
.PN traceroute
options are:
.TP
.B \-m
Sets the max time-to-live (max number of hops) used in outgoing probe
packets.  The default is 30 hops which is the same default used for TCP
connections.
.TP
.B \-n
Prints hop addresses numerically rather than symbolically and numerically.
This saves a nameserver address-to-name lookup for each gateway found on the
path.
.TP
.B \-p
Sets the base UDP port number used in probes (default is 33434).
The  
.PN traceroute
command presumes that nothing is listening on UDP ports
.I base
to
.I base+nhops-1
at the destination host (so an ICMP PORT_UNREACHABLE message will
be returned to terminate the route tracing).  If another process
islistening on a port in the default range, this option can be used
to pick an unused port range.
.TP
.B \-r
Bypasses the normal routing tables and sends directly to a host on an attached
network.
If the host is not on a directly-attached network,
an error is returned.
This option can be used to ping a local host through an interface
that has no route through it (for example, after the interface was dropped by
.MS routed 8c .
.TP
.B \-s
Uses the following IP address (which must be given as an IP number, not
a hostname) as the source address in outgoing probe packets.  On
hosts with more than one IP address, this option can be used to
force the source address to be something other than the IP address
of the interface on which the probe packet is sent. If the IP address
is not one of this machine's interface addresses, an error is
returned and nothing is sent.
.TP
.B \-t
Sets the
.I type-of-service
in probe packets to the following value (default zero).  The value must be 
a decimal integer in the range 0 to 255.  This option can be used to
see if different types-of-service result in different paths.  (If you
are not running 4.4BSD, this option is not relevant to you because
services like telnet and ftp do not let you control the 
.I type-of-service .)
Not all values of 
.I type-of-service 
are legal or meaningful \- see the IP spec for definitions.
Useful values are probably `-t 16' (low delay) and `-t 8' (high throughput).
.TP
.B \-v
Verbose output.  Received ICMP packets other than TIME_EXCEEDED and
UNREACHABLEs are listed.
.TP
.B \-w
Sets the time (in seconds) to wait for a response to a probe.  The
default is 3 seconds.

.EE
Note that lines 2 and 3 are identical.  This is due to a bug in the 
kernel on the 2nd hop system \- lbl-csam.arpa \- that forwards
packets with a zero ttl (a bug in the distributed version
of 4.3BSD).  Note that you have to guess what path
the packets are taking cross-country since the NSFNet (129.140)
does not supply address-to-name translations for its NSSes.

.EE
Note that the gateways 12, 14, 15, 16 and 17 hops away
either do not send ICMP "time exceeded" messages or send them
with a ttl too small to reach localhost.  Gateways 14 through 17 are 
running the MIT C Gateway code that does not send "time exceeded"
messages.  It is unclear what is happening with gateway 12.
.PP
The silent gateway 12 in the above may be the result of a bug in
the 4.[23]BSD network code (and its derivatives):  4.x (x <= 3)
sends an unreachable message using whatever ttl remains in the
original datagram.  Since, for gateways, the remaining ttl is
zero, the ICMP "time exceeded" is guaranteed to not make it back
to us.  
.PP
When this bug appears on the destination system
it behaves as follows:
.EX
 1  helios.ee.lbl.gov (128.3.112.1)  0 ms  0 ms  0 ms

.EE
Note that there are 12 "gateways" (13 is the final
destination) and the last half of them are "missing".
What is happening is that the host rip (a Sun-3 running Sun OS3.5)
is using the ttl from our arriving datagram as the ttl in its
ICMP reply.  The reply will time out on the return path
(with no notice sent to anyone since ICMP's are not sent for
ICMP's) until we probe with a ttl that is at least twice the path
length.  This means that the host rip is really only 7 hops away.  
.PP
A reply that
returns with a ttl of 1 is a clue this problem exists.
The 
.PN traceroute 
prints a "!" after the time if the ttl is less than or 
equal to 1.  Since many systems continue to run obsolete or
non-standard software, expect to see this problem frequently.
.PP
Other possible annotations after the time are
.BR !H ,
.BR !N ,
.B !P
(got a host, network or protocol unreachable, respectively),
.B !S
or
.B !F
(source route failed or fragmentation needed \- if either of these
occurs, the associated gateway is broken).  If
almost all the probes result in some kind of unreachable, the
.PN traceroute
command will give up and exit.
.PP
This program is intended for use in network testing, measurement
and management.  It should be used primarily for manual fault isolation.
Because of the load it could impose on the network, you should not use
.PN traceroute
during normal operations or from automated scripts.
