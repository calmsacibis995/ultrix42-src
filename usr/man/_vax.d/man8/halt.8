.SH Description
.NXR "halt command"
.NXR "processor" "halting"
The
.PN halt
command
writes out sandbagged information to the disks and then stops
the processor.  The machine does not reboot, even if the auto-reboot
switch is set on the console.
.SH Options
.IP \-n 5
Prevents the sync before stopping.  
.IP \-q
Causes a quick halt, no graceful shutdown is attempted.  
.IP \-y
Halts the system from a dialup.
.SH Restrictions
It is very difficult to halt a VAX, as the machine wants to then
reboot itself.  A rather tight loop suffices.
.SH See Also
reboot(8), shutdown(8)
