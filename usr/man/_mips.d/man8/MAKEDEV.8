.SH Description
.NXR "MAKEDEV command" "making special files"
The 
.PN MAKEDEV
shell script is normally used to install
special files. It resides in the 
.B /dev
directory, the normal location of special files.
Arguments to 
.PN MAKEDEV 
are usually of the form
.IR device-name ?
where
.I device-name
is one of the supported devices listed in Section 4 of the
.I "ULTRIX Reference Pages"
and ? is a logical unit number.  A few
special arguments create assorted collections of devices and are
listed below.
.IP DECstation* 13
Creates a DECstation specific setup. 
.IP std
Creates all
.I standard
devices for all systems.
.IP local
Creates those devices specific to the local site.  This
request causes the shell file
.PN /dev/MAKEDEV.local
to be executed.  Site specific commands, such as those
used to setup dialup lines as ttyd?, should be included
in this file.
.PP
Because all devices are created using
.MS mknod 8 ,
this shell script is useful only to the superuser.
.SH Diagnostics
Either self-explanatory, or generated by one of the programs
called from the script.  Use 
.PN "sh -x MAKEDEV "
in case of trouble.
