.SH Description
.NXR "reboot command"
.NXA "reboot command" "rc command"
.NXR "bootstrap procedure"
.NXr "system" "rebooting"
The ULTRIX system is booted by loading a kernel image, usually 
.PN /vmunix ,
into memory at location zero and transferring to zero.
Because the system is not reenterable,
the kernel image must be read in from disk 
each time the system is bootstrapped.
.PP
When the reboot of a running system is desired,
.PN shutdown
is normally used.  If there are no users, 
.PN /etc/reboot 
can be used.  The
.PN reboot
command causes the disks to be synced, and then a multiuser
reboot is initiated.  The system is 
booted and an automatic disk check is performed.
If the procedure succeeds, the system is then brought up for the users.
.PP
The system will reboot itself after a power failure or after a crash,
provided auto-restart is enabled on your system.
A consistency check of the file systems will be performed
and, unless the check fails, the system will resume multiuser operations.
.SH Options
.IP \-n 5
Prevents the disks from being synced.
.IP \-q
Reboots quickly and ungracefully, without shutting down running
processes first.
