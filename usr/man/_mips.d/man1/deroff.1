.SH Syntax
.B deroff
[\fB\-w\fR] \fIfile...\fR
.SH Description
.NXR "deroff interpreter"
The
.PN deroff
command
reads each file in sequence and removes all
.PN nroff
and
.PN troff
command lines, backslash constructions, macro definitions,
.PN eqn
constructs (between .EQ and .EN lines or between delimiters),
and table descriptions and writes the remainder on the standard output.
The
.PN deroff
command
follows chains of included files (.so and .nx commands);
if a file has already been included, the .so command is ignored and an .nx
command terminates execution.  If no input file is given,
.PN deroff
reads from the standard input file.
.SH Options
.IP \fB\-w\fR 5
Generates word list (one word per line).
.SH Restrictions
.NXR "deroff interpreter" "restricted"
The
.PN deroff
command
is not a complete
.PN troff
interpreter, so it can be confused by subtle constructs.
Most errors result in too much rather than too little output.
.PP
The
.B \-w 
flag removes every one\- or two\-character word.
