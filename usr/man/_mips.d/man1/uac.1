.SH Description
.NXR "uac command"
The
.PN uac
command controls the printing of "Fixed up unaligned data access for
pid nnn at pc 0xAddr" messages.  The command is used to set or
display the flag that controls printing the message for the
system or for the parent process of the user, which is typically a shell.
.PP
If \fIvalue\fR is present, the flag is set; otherwise, the current
flag setting is displayed.  The \fIvalue\fR can be either a zero (0), 
which turns the flag off, or a one (1), which turns the flag on.
If both the system and the user flags are on (set, 1) the 
unaligned data access errors are reported to the user.  
If either flag is off (not set, 0), the unaligned
data access errors are not reported.
.SH Options
The following options can be used with the 
.PN uac
command:
.IP \fBs\fR 5
Set/display the current flag setting for the system.
.IP \fBp\fR
Set/display the current flag setting for the parent process.
.SH Restrictions
You must be superuser to set the system flag.
