.PP
The
.PN rand
subroutine uses a multiplicative congruential
random number generator
with period 2\u\s732\s0\d
to return successive pseudo-random
numbers in the range from 0 to 2\u\s731\s10\d\-1.
.PP
The generator is reinitialized by calling
.PN srand
with 1 as argument.
It can be set to a random starting point by calling
.PN srand
with whatever you like as argument.
.SH Environment
For the System V environment, the
.PN rand
subroutine returns numbers in the range from 0 to 2\u\s715\s10\d\-1.
