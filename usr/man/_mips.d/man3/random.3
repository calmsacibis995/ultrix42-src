.SH Description
.NXR "random subroutine"
.NXR "srandom subroutine"
.NXR "initstate subroutine"
.NXR "setstate subroutine"
.NXA "rand subroutine (standard C)" "random subroutine"
.NXR "random number generator"
The
.PN random
subroutine
uses a non-linear additive feedback random number generator employing a
default table of size 31 long integers
to return successive pseudo-random
numbers in the range from 0 to (2**31)-1.  The period of this
random number generator is
very large, approximately 16*((2**31)-1).
.PP
The
.PN random/srandom
subroutines
have (almost) the same calling sequence and initialization properties as
.PN rand/srand .
The difference is that rand(3)
produces a much less random sequence \- in fact, the low dozen bits
generated by rand go through a cyclic pattern.
All the bits generated by
.PN random
are usable.  For
example, \*(lqrandom()&01\*(rq will produce a random binary
value.
.PP
Unlike
.PN srand ,
.PN srandom
does not return the old seed; the reason for this is that the amount of
state information used is much more than a single word.  (Two other
routines are provided to deal with restarting/changing random
number generators.)  Like 
.MS rand 3 ,
however,
.PN random
will by default produce a sequence of numbers that can be duplicated
by calling
.PN srandom
with 
.I 1
as the seed.
.PP
The
.PN initstate
routine allows a state array, passed in as an argument, to be initialized
for future use.  The size of the state array (in bytes) is used by
.PN initstate
to decide how sophisticated a random number 
generator it should use \- the
more state, the better the random numbers will be.
(Current "optimal" values for the amount of state information are
8, 32, 64, 128, and 256 bytes; other amounts will be rounded down to
the nearest known amount.  Using less than 8 bytes will cause an error).
The seed for the initialization (which specifies a starting point for
the random number sequence, and provides for restarting at the same
point) is also an argument.
.PN Initstate
returns a pointer to the previous state information array.
.PP
Once a state has been initialized, the
.PN setstate
routine provides for rapid switching between states.
The
.PN setstate
subroutine returns a pointer to the previous state array; its
argument state array is used for further random number generation
until the next call to
.PN initstate
or
.PN setstate .
.PP
Once a state array has been initialized, it may be restarted at a
different point either by calling
.PN initstate
(with the desired seed, the state array, and its size) or by calling
both
.PN setstate
(with the state array) and
.PN srandom
(with the desired seed).
The advantage of calling both
.PN setstate
and
.PN srandom
is that the size of the state array does not have to be remembered after
it is initialized.
.PP
With 256 bytes of state information, the period of the random number
generator is greater than 2\u\s769\s10\d, which should be sufficient for
most purposes.
.SH Diagnostics
If
.PN initstate
is called with less than 8 bytes of state information, or if
.PN setstate
detects that the state information has been garbled, error
messages are printed on the standard error output.
