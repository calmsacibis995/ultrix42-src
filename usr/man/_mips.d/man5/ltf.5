.SH Description
.NXB "ltf file" "format"
.NXB "magnetic tape" "labeling"
.NXAM "ltf command" "ltf file"
.NXS "labeled tape facility" "ltf file"
The term "ltf" (Labeled Tape Facility) refers
to the group of programs required to fulfill
the features and functionality outlined here.

References for the substance of this document are based on:

ANSI X3.27-1978
.NXR "ANSI X3.27-1978 standard"

Public Review Comment on ANSI X3L5/83-28T 15-Oct-84
(describes the version 4 ANSI standard)
.PP
This proposed implementation of the 
.PN ltf 
does not claim to  be
100% ANSI standard in all cases. 
That is, the ULTRIX 
.PN ltf 
does not support the entirety of the 
functionality or format capabilities outlined in the 
documents/publications cited as references.
.PP
It should be understood that the functionality and formats for
ULTRIX-labeled tapes are simply based on the standards and
formats referred to, and described in, the publications/documents
listed previously.
.PP
The 
.PN ltf
attempts to follow these documents as working
precepts as accurately as it can, while meeting the needs of
ULTRIX systems.
.PP
It should be further understood that where the cited documents
specify procedures or operational constricts that would conflict 
with those features/functionality normally found in an 
ULTRIX system, the procedures or operational constricts, 
by necessity, have been omitted from the 
.PN ltf 
implementation.
.PP
The goals of 
.PN ltf 
are to create an accurate exchange of information
between ULTRIX systems and between ULTRIX and non-ULTRIX systems as an
import/export facility by providing a means to read/write tapes
in a format generally acceptable to most systems providing support of 
ANSI-labeled tapes.
.PP
It is not a goal of 
.PN ltf 
to provide the multivolume file sets 
or to provide 100% of the ANSI specifications
for the following labels on non-ULTRIX generated volumes:
.EX 0
VOL1
    Accessibility Field
VOL2 - VOL9
UVL1 - UVL9 (User Volume Labels)
HDR1, EOV1, EOF1
    File-set Identifier
    Expiration Date
    Accessibility Field
    Block Count
HDR2
    Buffer Offset Content
HDR3 - HDR9
UHL1 - UHL9 (User Header Labels)
EOV3 - EOV9 (End of Volume Labels)
EOF3 - EOF9 (End of File Labels)
ULT1 - UTL9 (User Trailer Labels)
.EE
The FORMATS
section provides the general ANSI volume and label formats.
Each label consists of 80 bytes of ASCII data as specified. 
Items enclosed in parentheses () indicate optional fields that 
may be present according to the ANSI standard. 
The following terms are used as indicated:
.TP 5
"a" 
Refers to the sets of characters including
uppercase (A-Z), 
numerals (0-9), and special characters (space ! " % & ' ( ) * + , - _ . / : ; < = > ?).
.RE
.TP 5
BLOCK
.NXR "block" "defined"
A group of consecutive bytes of data treated as a unit by the storage 
medium.  
Blocks are separated by an interblock gap. 
A block may contain part of a record, all of the record, or many 
records.
.TP 5
BLOCK LENGTH
.NXR "block length" "defined"
The minimum block size is 18 bytes and the maximum is 20480.
.TP 5
RECORD
.NXR "record" "defined"
A set of related data treated as a unit of information:
.TP 5
TAPE MARK
.NXR "tape mark" "defined"
A control block used as a delimiter.

EOV1 - Label Format - ANSI VERSION 3/4

First End-Of-Volume label that, if read before the first End Of File 
label (EOF1), indicates that the file is continued on the 
next volume.
For valid hardware and software technical limitations,
the ULTRIX 
.PN ltf 
does not support multivolume file sets
and therefore does not output these labels.
If present on an input volume, they are interpreted
as indicating an error condition, due to the fact that
some portion of the file will not be processed.
The fields of this label are identical to the contents of
the corresponding fields in the First File Header Label (HDR1),
with the exceptions noted below.
The following diagrams of EOV labels are intended for
