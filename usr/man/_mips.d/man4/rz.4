.SH Description

.NXR "SCSI disk interface"
.NXR "uda interface" "SCSI disk interface"
.PP
The 
.PN rz
driver is for all Digital SCSI disk drives.
.PP
The following rules are used to determine the major and minor numbers that 
are associated with an 
.PN rz
type disk.  There is one major number used to represent  
.PN rz 
disks.  The major number represents 32 disks.
The minor number is used to represent the both the SCSI unit
number and partition.  A disk partition refers to a designated portion
of the physical disk.
To accomplish this, the 8-bit minor number is broken up
into two parts.  The low three bits of the minor number specify a disk
partition.  These three bits allow for the naming of eight partitions.  The
partitions have a letter, a through h, as their name.  
The upper five bits of the minor
number specify the SCSI unit number within a group of 32 disks.
.PP
The device special file names associated with 
.PN rz 
disks are based on 
the following conventions.  These conventions are closely associated with
the minor number assigned to the disk. 
The standard device names begin with
.PN rz 
for the block special file and
.PN rrz 
for the raw (character) special file.
Following the
.PN rz
is the logical unit number and then a letter, a through h, to represent
the partition.  Throughout this reference page, the question mark (?) 
character represents
the logical unit number in the name of the device special file.  For example,
rz?b could represent rz0b, rz1b, and so on.
.PP
The following examples illustrate how the SCSI unit number is
calculated given the major and minor number of an 
.PN rz
disk.  For the device special file rrz6a, the major number is 56 and the
minor number is 48.  The partition is represented by the lower three
bits of the number 48.  The lower 
three bits are 0, which specifies the ``a'' partition.  The
upper five bits of 48 specify the number 6.  The major number is 56.  Because
56 is the base major number, it represents the group of 32 disks. 
Putting all these pieces together reveals that the major/minor pair 56/48
refers to the ``a'' partition of SCSI unit 6. 
.PP
The disk can be accessed through either the block special file or the 
character special file.  The block special file accesses the disk using
the file system's normal buffering mechanism.  Reads and writes to the block
special file can specify any size.  This avoids the need to limit data 
transfers to the size of physical disk records and to calculate offsets
within disk records.
The file system can break up large read and write requests into smaller 
fixed size transfers to the disk.
.PP
The character special file provides a raw interface that allows for
direct transmission between the disk and the user's read or write buffer.
In contrast to the block special file, reads and writes to the raw interface
must be done on full sectors only.  
For this reason, 
in raw I/O, counts must be a multiple of 512 bytes (a disk sector).
In the same manner,
.PN seek
calls must specify a multiple of 512 bytes.
A single read or write to the raw interface results in 
exactly one I/O operation.
Consequently raw I/O may be considerably more efficient for large transfers.
Multiply buffered I/O operations are
possible to any raw SCSI device. (See 
.MS nbuf 4 
for more information.)
.PP
For systems with SCSI disks, the first boot of the ULTRIX software after
the system is powered on may take longer than expected. This delay is
normal and is caused by the software spinning up the SCSI disk drives.
.SS Disk Support
.NXR "SCSI disk interface" "disk support"
This driver handles all disk drives that can be connected to the SCSI bus.
Consult the 
.I "ULTRIX Software Product Description" 
to determine which drives
are supported for which CPU types and hardware configurations.
.PP
The starting location and length (in 512 byte sectors) 
of the disk partitions of each
drive are shown in the following table.
Partition sizes can be changed by 
.MS chpt 8 .

Usually, the rz?a partition is used for the root file system and
the rz?b partition as a paging area.
The rz?c partition is used for disk-to-disk copying because 
it maps the entire disk.
