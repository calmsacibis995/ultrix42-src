This directory contains the lat directory which contains the
lat include files. These are here simply to help make compiling easier.
making lpd always fails beacause the include files in /sys/lat can
never be found.

To make use of this directory log in as root.

rmdir /sys/lat
ln -s /usr/src/usr.lib/lpr/sys/lat /sys/lat
make lpd
rm /sys/lat
mkdir /sys/lat
