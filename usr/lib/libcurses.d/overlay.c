The bug found in overlay() is where the last line of the window
being overlayed is not overlayed.   It seems that the
extraction of this library from "vi" has bitten us again.
The problem is that the computation of "endy" takes into account
the fact that "_maxy" is "1 relative".  The subtraction of 1 now makes
it "0 relative", but the for-loop is treating it as "1 relative".
