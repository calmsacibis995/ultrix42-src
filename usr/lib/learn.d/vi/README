Installation:

This directory contains everything you need to install the vi learn sequence.
Assuming that the rest of the learn scripts on your system are stored in the
directory LEARNDIR (usually it's /usr/lib/learn), do the following things to
install it:

	1) Make a new directory LEARNDIR/vi which is publicly readable
	   and put all of these files there.

	2) Change the files LEARNDIR/Linfo and LEARNDIR/Xinfo to
	   include vi in the list of available learn subjects.

	3) If LEARNDIR isn't '/usr/lib/learn' on your system, then you'll
	   have to change the pathname of the file longtext which is 
	   referenced in several of the lessons.  Just type
			    fgrep longtext L*
	   to get a list of the files you'll have to change.
