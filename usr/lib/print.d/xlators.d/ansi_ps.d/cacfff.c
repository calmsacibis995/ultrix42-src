 *
 *	10-MAR-1988 14:24 mhw
 *      Initial Version 
 *
 *	24-MAY-1988 10:26  mhw
 *	Add references to dll_font structure defined in capdl.def
 *
 *	31-MAY-1988 14:15  mhw
 *	Add type_size_whole and type_size_fraction for the LN04
 *	Changed substitute_flag to MAX_CSET_SIZE if substitute error char,
 *	    MAX_CSET_SIZE+1 if not substitution,
 *	    and 0-(MAX_CSET_SIZE-1) if character substitution
 *
 *	22-AUG-1988 10:13 mhw
 *	Add returns after abort macros such that analyze will not continue
 *	after an error.  This is the way the Translator use to work.
 *
 *	12-SEP-1988 09:35  mhw
 *	Changed BYTE to UBYTE for ABORT_MACRO test 62 and 67
 *
 *	15-SEP-1988 16:04 mhw
 *	Added character replacement, then commented out until translator
 *	side is ready for this.  It will then need to be re-activated.
 *	This addition adds Warnings (87) and (88) and Abort (89)
 *
 *	Changed Abort (68) to Warning (68) as per CFFF meeting held on
 *	1/12/88 and described in the Parser Notes File, note 19.1
 *
 *	Removed Abort (65) since with character replacement, Bit 31 of
 *	the character locator can be set - it is no longer an error.
 *
 *	14-OCT-1988 14:48 mwh
 *	Added support for overline to dll_font.
 *
 *	 3-NOV-1988 09:44 mhw
 *	Added angle brackets to stdio for ultrix support
 *
 *	 1-DEC-1988 10:46 mhw
 *	If no space character exists in a 94 character set, the substitute
 *	flag must be set to MAX_CSET_SIZE + 1, because we create a space for
 *	it.  It was set to MAX_CSET_SIZE and so the translator substituted
 *	a blob.

/* file:  xlc_analyze.c -- analyze the DCS buffer, which contains a CFFF font.
 * edit:  laf  6-JUN-1986 16:12:04 Added conditional compile of fprintf's.
 *	  nv   27-JUN-1986 18:15:23 Fixed dll_char_set_id so that font files 
 *	       which claim to have a USER_PREFERENCE character set are
 *	       re-identified as DEC_SUPPLEMENTAL.
 *	  laf  27-JUN-1986 20:29:53 Changed length of all tables and arrays
 *	       from MAX_CSET_SIZE to MAX_CSET_SIZE+1 so that we can always
 *	       stuff the error char in the last slot of each table so that 
 * 	       Nick's font code can access it easily and it can be shipped 
 *	       to the PS machine just like any other character.
 *	  gh   16-JUL-1986 09:06:04 Right bearing is calculated using 'numcols'
 *		before numcols is set - moving setting of numcols before the
 *		right bearing is calculated.
 *	  nv   18-JUL-1986 18:07:24 Add provisions to force space characters 
 *		under certain circumstances.
 *	  nv   22-JUL-1986 12:54:07 Disabled enunciation of font file errors.
 *
 *	araj	 1-AUG-1986 22:43:08 
 *		Looking for initialization problems.
 *		Included Copyright notice, that had been forgotten.
 *		Added use of conditional compile, to make use
 *		of ERROR macro easier.
 *
 *	araj	 4-AUG-1986 15:47:31 
 *		added test in dump routine to ensure the 
 *		character does not overflow the dump area
 *
 *		Moved MAXCOLS, MAXROWS, MAXBITMAP to XLATE.H
 *
 *	araj	 4-AUG-1986 18:56:10 
 *		Added two additional chack variables, 
 *		number_of_bytes_in_bitamp, and 
 *		number_of_odd_words_in_bitmap to verify that 
 *		some of the files that were rejected were
 *		rejected because the creator was counting
 *		bytes, not rouded up words.
 *
 *		Did not do anything with this yet, 
 *		just printing it in the analyze log file.
 *		we can decide later whether to accept or
 *		reject such files.
 *	nv	 12-AUG-1986 16:05:30 
 *		Put conditional compilation stuff around VM monitoring print 
 *		statement.
 *		Added 'include "dbug.h"' at the beginning of this module.
 *		Part of error 68 was reunited with the rest of it and shuffled 
 *		around; sometime earlier additional code had been inserted
 *		among the code for managing 'error 68' and this created a
 *		nonsensical stretch of code.
 *
 *	laf	Added conditional compile of the code that reads the
 *		following fields out of the CFFF, because nobody uses them
 *		in the current translator:
 *			dll_num_char_defs
 *			dll_monospacing_flag
 *			dll_font_horiz_prop
 *			dll_horiz_prop_numerator
 *			dll_horiz_prop_denominator
 *			dll_below_baseline_dist
 *
 *	gh	 18-AUG-1986 14:34:54 Laurie left nested #ifdefs that did
 *		 not start in column 1 - fixed it.  This goes on her record.
 *	nv	 20-AUG-1986 10:17:02 Standardized the left margins so that 
 *		this module agrees with xlc_cont.c.
 *		Moved conditional compilation controls to dbug.h.
 *		Changed conditional compilation controls from '#ifdef' to 
 *		'#if'.
 *		Add printout of font file id along with error 68. 
 *		Moved definition of MAX_CSET_SIZE to xlate.h 
 *		Removed ERROR_CODE definition -- obsolete. 
 *		Made changes so that for glyphs with no bit-map (i.e., space) 
 *		dll_char [i] .bitmap_ptr = NULL_BITMAP; this necessary so the 
 *		software which removes redundant error characters to work. 
 *	nv	 21-AUG-1986 10:25:41 removed .num_wds_in_bitmap from the 
 *		DLL_FONT_CHAR structure and associated software. This happened
 *		to involve fixing as well as changing the determination of
 *		width for the forced space capability. 
 *		Add printout of font file id along with error 56.
 *		Streamlined calculation of 'number_of_odd_words_in_bitmaps'.
 *		Fixed 'dump2' print statement of number of characters 
 *		replaced by blob references.
 *		Fixed an index in the 
 *	nv	 22-AUG-1986 10:08:18 Added comments.
 *	nv	 27-AUG-1986 15:33:11 Put the checking for complete character 
 *		set (the 'ZZZZ' problem) under the conditional compilation of
 *		COMPLETE_ANALYSIS.
 *		Added check that dll_last_character >= dll_first_character.
 *		In an attempt to ensure that 'divide by zero' do not occur,
 *		added checks that the following parameters are not zero:
 *			dll_total_vertical_size,
 *			dll_horiz_prop_numerator,
 *			dll_horiz_prop_denominator;
 *		Changed 'dll_average_char_width' to 'dll_space_width' in the 
 *		software for forcing space characters under certain
 *		circumstances. 
 *		Changed the definition of dll_spacing from UBYTE to UWORD.
 *	nv	 28-AUG-1986 18:34:06 Included checks for consistent font 
 *		widths and  character widths for monospaced fonts.
 *	gh	 1-SEP-1986 10:17:14 Changed the 32-bit arithmetic flag test &
 *		the test for the four 'Z's in the char set ID to only output
 *		a message in COMPLETE_ANALYSIS mode, since it has been
 *		determined that these really aren't errors.  Also, the setting
 *		of dll_type_size has been changed to fetch UWORDS from WORDS,
 *		and a test is done before the fetch to ensure there won't be
 *		overflow from the caculation.  If there will be, an ERROR(101)
 *		is generated.
 *	nv	 3-SEP-1986 11:13:26 Moved 'number_of_odd_words_in_bitmaps' and
 *		'total_portrait_bytes' from local automatics within 'analyze'
 *		to globals declared at the beginning of this module.
 *	nv	 5-SEP-1986 19:22:57 Defined the following literals and used 
 *		the first two to replace constants where we generate our home
 *		made 'blob':
 *			NUMBER_OF_BLOB_ROWS,
 *			NUMBER_OF_BLOB_COLUMNS,
 *			BLOB_BITMAP_SIZE.
 *		Used BLOB_BITMAP_SIZE augment the total_portrait_bytes count
 *		when the error character is not defined within a downloaded
 *		font file and we have to use our own homemade 'blob'.
 *	nv	 8-SEP-1986 11:40:12 Fixed main for-loop, which analyzes the 
 *		individuals characters, to disregard direct, as well as
 *		indirect, references to 'blobs. 
 *	nv	 7-OCT-1986 13:04:58 Checked that neither 'dll_type_size' nor
 *		'dll_total_vertical_size' exceed 3 inches.
 *		Define MAX_FONT_SIZE to be 216 (point).
 *		Include a check that the dll_num_char_defs equals
 *		(end_idx - start_idx + 1).
 *		Removed definition of ERROR_MACRO.
 *		Replaced each use of ERROR_MACRO with 'ABORT_MACRO' except for
 *		old errors 52 and 56 which were replaced with 'WARNING_MACRO'.
 *		Removed the comment delimiters which used to be around errors
 *		52 and 56.
 *		Also, nearby errors 52 and 56, I found other code which put
 *		information into the dump2.dcs file but which needed to be
 *		couched in conditional compilation to prevent possible
 *		attempted output when the dump file was not opened; I made
 *		that code compiled conditionally according to 'WITHOUTPUT.'
 *		Removed superfluous 'return' statements which followed 
 *		'ABORT_MACRO'.
 *		Changed code compiled conditionally with respect to 
 *		ERROR_REPORT to compiled never.
 *	nv	 22-OCT-1986 10:45:08 Over-write 'dll_average_char_width' with
 *		'dll_space_width'.
 *	nv	 31-OCT-1986 14:19:55 Considering the change, converted
 *		ABORT_MACRO(71) to WARNING_MACRO(71) and placed it under
 *		'COMPLETE_ANALYSIS'.
 *	nv	 5-NOV-1986 12:48:03 Add provisions for a spacing code of '3'
 *		(6.8 cpi).
 *
 *	araj	 15-APR-1987 19:34:56 Add printing of more data for 
 *		ABORT 68 and 73
 *	araj	 1-JUL-1987 16:10:55 Add print statement for blob size 
 *		to help debug fonts
 *
 *	mgb	 21-JUL-1987 12:58:19 When calculating the number of bytes 
 *		in portrait, they (the creator of the fonts) forget to 
 *		include the blob and/or rounding. Made change to be 
 *		more accepting of the fonts and print them even if they are 
 * 		wrong. Now we will accept fonts even if they forget to do
 *		rounding and/or the blob.
 *
 * 	mgb	 9-NOV-1987 15:13:46 
 * 		For the sake of the LN04, compute the landscape bytecount, as 
 *		well as the mixed byte count, and run the font tests again (no 
 *		need to print anything, just the log with the warning/aborts is 
 *		sufficient.
 *
 *		To compute landscape byte count, I modified the code that 
 *		computes portrait byte count, but invert the role of x and y 
 *		(number_rows/number_columns).
 *
 *		To compute mixed byte count, take the max of portrait and 
 *		landscape on each char,
 *
 *		Whereve the code did the following:
 *
 *		     portrait_byte_count (character_i) = f (num_rows, numcols)
 *		     total_portrait_bytes += portrait_byte_count (character_i) 
 *
 *
 *		Was changed to do:
 *
 *		     portrait_byte_count (character_i)  = f (num_rows, num_cols)
 *		     landscape_byte_count (character_i) = f (num_cols, num_rows)
 *		     total_portrait_bytes  += portrait_byte_count (character_i) 
 *		     total_landscape_bytes += landscape_byte_count (character_i)
 *		     total_mixed_bytes     += MAX (total_portrait_bytes, 
 *		                                   total_landscape_bytes)
 *
 *		Then at the end, of analyze, a test was added to check the 
 *		computed values against the stored values, that we currently 
 *		do for portrait.
 *
 *	mgb	 16-NOV-1987 15:06:26 
 *		added the following code for mixed.
 *
 *		dll_even_blob_bitmap_size_mixed = MAX (P_even, L_even);
 *		dll_odd_blob_bitmap_size_mixed  = MAX (P_odd, L_odd);
 *		if (dll_even_blob_bitmap_size_mixed 
 *		 != dll_odd_blob_bitmap_size_mixed) 
 *		  number_of_odd_words_in_bm_mixed += 1;
 *
 *	kws	 14-JAN-1988 19:26:13 
 *		Fixed bug in calculating mixed byte count.
 *            
 *	kws	 14-JAN-1988 19:35:08 
 *              Move where start_idx and end_idx are filled in.

   * The CFFF, in  3.3.16.1-2, clearly indicates that the 'FIRST CHARACTER'

   * to the printable characters of the character set and should exclude
   * non-printable character (7/f in particular was cited as an example).
   * Nevertheless, font file creators have, as usual, been ignoring the CFFF
   * guidelines and, with the elan of hackers, have been exploiting the fact
   * that the error character is usual placed after the last printable
   * character (e.g., in ASCII 7/e = '~') In particular, they frequently
   * specify the 'LAST CHARACTER' as '7/f'. In this way they ambiguously
   * show that '7/f' is an error character regardless of whether the font
   * file is a character set of 94 or 96 characters. (To date, all character
   * sets have been the 94 type.) Actually, how '7/f' is handled, unless it
   * IS printable, should be outside the perview of this loop and would be
   * if the CFFF were enforced. Since the CFFF is not enforced we have to
   * make the following check to ensure that the error character bit-map
   * size is not counted more than once. 
   *
   * Not only do we have to contend with this irregularity but also there is
   * tendency for font file designers to reference the extra last character
   * (i.e. '7/f') as the error character directly (i.e., by its locator in the
   * CFFF) rather than indirectly (i.e., with a '0' locator, indicating a
   * non-defined character) as is done with all other undefined characters. In
   * other words, there is complete disregard of the proper meaning, or at
