/* Re-written to be reasonable
 * Mon Nov 15 17:19:52 EST 1982
 * Alan S. Watt (ittvax!swatt)
 *
 * Tom Truscott (rti!trt):
 * Priority ordering cleaned up.  New 'pcompar' subroutine.
 * 'stat' removed (speeds things up).
 * Possible infinite loop in gtwvec defended against.
 * Feb 23, 1983
 *
 * Changes:
 *
 *  1)	The check for work is much faster; the first filename
 *	that matches the prefix causes a "yes" return.
 *
 *  2)	The filename is not "stat" ed , so
 *	there is no massive delay while the list of potential
 *	names is built.
 *
 *  3)	Requesting work for a new system is now detected so
 *	internal variables are re-initialized properly.  In
 *	particular, the stream pointer for the current work
 *	file is properly closed so work for a system which
 *	hangs up will not be sent to the next system called.
 *
 * Fri Dec  3 09:31:45 EST 1982
 *
 *  5)	As new work files are requested, a check is made
 *	every TLIMIT seconds (5 minutes at present) to see
 *	if new files have entered the spool area.  Since
 *	work file names are now cached up to LLEN, this can
 *	represent a very long transmission time before new
 *	work enters the list to be processed.  If people want
 *	to use the "grade" character to specify a higher
 *	priority, the list must be re-built and re-sorted for
 *	higher priority stuff to have an immediate effect.
 *
 *  6)  small changes to run under new spooling system - decvax!larry
