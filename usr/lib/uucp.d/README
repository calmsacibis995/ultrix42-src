Enhancements:

Dialers			Lots of dialers included.

Subdirectories		/usr/spool/uucp/sys contains per system subdirectories
			and a DEFAULT directory.  This is a huge help on busy 
			systems.

/usr/var/uucp/L.cmds	List of commands permitted for remote execution.
			A line of form 'PATH=...' sets the search path.
			Execution levels must be assigned to each command.
			See Installation and Administration Guide.
			

expect-send sequence	Escape characters now permitted: \r, \n.
			\r, not \n, is default char sent at end of string.
			\c	(put at end of string). Dont send ending \r.
			\d	pause 1 second (\d\d pauses 2 seconds)
			"" P_ZERO  `expect nothing, start sending zero parity.'
			P_EVEN (default), P_ODD, P_ONE other parity modes.
			\05	Send a control-E
			"" ""   `expect nothing, send a \r'.

uupoll [sysname]	Polls named system.

uumonitor		Displays spooled files, and pending uuxqts.

uuxqt			uuxqt can operate on a per command type basis
			by using "-c" option. 
			i.e.  uuxqt -cname_of_command.  It will default
			to a general poll of commands.
			Several uuxqt's can now run concurrently.
			.XQTDIR now lives in /usr/spool/uucp.

uuclean			the -s option has been added. -sALL will clean
			all system subdirectories.  -ssystem_name will
			clean spool directories belonging to system_name. 
			uuclean will only mail back files if the -m option
			is used.  Otherwise results will be mailed to "uucp".

uucp			the -W option prevents expansion of file names that
			reside on remote systems.  Normally files names are
			prepended with the current working directory if the
			full path of the file was not specified.  

uucico			the -f option will force a connection attempt to
			a specified system regardless of the system status
			(STST. file).

uumkspool		creates all subdirectories for the specified systems(s).

uurespool		move files from old spool directories to new spool
			format.  Also useful for moving files out of DEFAULT
			into newly created per system spool directory.

uucompact		compact spool directories. -sALL or -sname_of_system.
			The uucp subsystem must be inactive for this to function
			properly. Single user is best.  If uucompact is stopped
			it can be started again, picking up where it left off.

USERFILE		the format of the USERFILE has changed to increase
			security and make it more legible.
			Read the Installation and Administration Guide 
			(System Managers Guide).

Debugging output	the -x option of the uu commands has been split out
			to -x and -X.  -X provides packet level output (i.e.
			from the pk routines).  -x provides all other debugging
			output.




This version runs on all VAXen and PDPs under UNIX-V7M11 and 4.1bsd, 4.2BSD.

UUCP installers should read the two papers (by Dave Nowitz)
in Vol 2B of version 7 manuals.
They should then read the "UUCP Installation and Administration Guide"
provided in the System Managers Guide of the Ultrix documentation set.
Understand each step below before executing.
Some steps will vary slightly from system to system.

**** INSTALLATION *******
If you are starting with a new binary only Ultrix kit you only need
to perform steps 6, 7, 11, and 12.

1. If you are currently running uucp, save the old programs!:
	su root
	cd directory_where_makefile_resides
	make save

2. Editing Makefile and uucp.h  - you should skip this step
   if you are running Ultrix/32 and are not adding/changing source code.

	4.2 sites using the supported dialers are all set with defaults.

	non-4.2
		a) sites need to install the Berkeley directory reading library.
			Try (cd LIBNDIR; make install).
			Edit Makefile to have LIBNDIR= -lndir
			define NDIR in uucp.h.
		b) Check LDFLAGS, OWNER, GROUP, and LIBUUCICO.
		c) pick a method to allow uucp to know its system:
			Check out UNAME/UUNAME/WHOAMI/CCWHOAMI in uucp.h
		d) define SYSIII if appropriate in uucp.h.
		e) Your "make" may fail because the Makefile is so large.
			If so, in /usr/src/cmds/make/defs, change
			'#define NFLEFTS 60' to 512, and re-make make.

3. Make the new commands. (object only sites should  skip this step)
	make

4. WAIT UNTIL THE UUCP SYSTEM IS IDLE!! Single-user is best.
	su root  (it is important that chmod and chown work below)

5. Install the new commands:  (object only sites so not do this step)
	make install

6. Edit and install the control files:
	Edit and install into /usr/var/uucp if necessary
	USERFILE, L.cmds, L.sys, L-devices, L-dialcodes.
	THESE FILES MUST BE OWNED BY THE SAME OWNER AND GROUP AS
	THE UUCP COMMANDS AND UUCP SPOOL FILES!!! (probably uucp, daemon).
	The format for dialers is slightly different so that any dialer
	can be handled.
	Refer to "The Uucp Installation and Adminstration Guide" for details.

7. Make new subdirectories:
	For safety:  cd /usr/spool/uucp; tar c .   (save Qed files on tape)
	The following assumes your site name is produced by `uuname -l`.

	make mkdirs

		This will make all spool directories including the DEFAULT
		system spool directory: /usr/spool/uucp/sys/DEFAULT.

	For each additional site that will have its own subdirectory :

		/usr/var/uucp/uumkspool system

8. Move old Qed files:
	If you have spooled files, they must be moved into the subdirectories.
	Assuming all spool files are in /usr/spool/uucp
	(i.e. you did not have subdirectories before)
	the following command will move the spool files
	to the new system directories:
	
	/usr/var/uucp/uurespool -t1

	Foreach system directory that was created with uumkspool
	the following actions occur (assuming the name of your system
	is duke):
	Files beginning C. are put in the C. subdirectory.
	Files beginning with D.dukeX are put in that directory, *not* D..
	Files beginning with D.duke are put in the D.duke directory.
	All other D.files are put in the D. directory.
	X.files are put in the X. directory

    Delete other old directories if you had any (e.g. "LOG.")

9. Compact spool directories:
	From time to time it may be necessary to compact spool
	directories.  The following command facilitates this:
	
	/usr/var/uucp/uucompact -sALL or -sname_of_system

	note: the uucp subsystem should be quiescent before and during
		the execution of uucompact.  

10. clear out status files:
	cd /usr/var/uucp
	cp /dev/null L_stat
	cp /dev/null R_stat

11. Test the new system
	Test by mailing a letter somewhere and back.
	If it works, the new system is probably fine.
	Otherwise, figure out what is wrong.
	Start by examining LOGFILE.  Try /usr/var/uucp/uucico -r1 -sname -x7
	If things are no-go, you can back out the changes by restoring the
	old uu programs and the spooled files.


12. Install administrative scripts (uucp.hour, uucp.day, ...)
	as described in the Installation and Administration Guide.

	These scripts should be run via cron.
