"It is bad luck to be superstitious."

%%
There is only one fortune in /usr/games/lib/fortunes.dat
%%
To add fortunes, put them in a file with each fortune separated by a
line that contains only two % signs.  Use that file
as an argument to /usr/games/lib/strfile, which produces a file
named fortunes.dat.  Put the fortunes.dat file in /usr/games/lib with 
read permissions set.
