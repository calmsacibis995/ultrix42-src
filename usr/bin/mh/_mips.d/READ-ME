   NAME
     mh-gen - generating the MH system

   READ THIS
     This documentation describes how to configure, generate, and install the
     UCI version of the RAND _M_H system.  Be certain to read this document
     completely before you begin.  You probably will also want to familiarize
     yourself with the _M_H Administrator's Guide before you install _M_H.

   DISCLAIMER
     Although the _M_H system was originally developed by the RAND Corporation,
     and is now in the public domain, the RAND Corporation assumes no respon-
     sibility for _M_H or this particular modification of _M_H.

     In addition, the Regents of the University of California issue the fol-
     lowing disclaimer in regard to the UCI version of _M_H:
          "Although each program has been tested by its contributor, no war-
          ranty, express or implied, is made by the contributor or the
          University of California, as to the accuracy and functioning of the
          program and related program material, nor shall the fact of distri-
          bution constitute any such warranty, and no responsibility is
          assumed by the contributor or the University of California in con-
          nection herewith."

     This version of _M_H is in the public domain, and as such, there are no
     real restrictions on its use.  The _M_H source code and documentation have
     no licensing restrictions whatsoever.  As a courtesy, the authors ask
     only that you provide appropriate credit to the RAND Corporation and the
     University of California for having developed the software.

   GETTING HELP
     _M_H is a software package that is neither supported by the RAND Corpora-
     tion nor the University of California.  However, since we do use the
     software ourselves and plan to continue using (and improving) _M_H, bug
     reports and their associated fixes should be reported back to us so that
     we may include them in future releases.  The current computer mailbox
     for _M_H is Bug-MH@ICS.UCI.EDU (in the ARPA Internet), and
     ...!ucbvax!ucivax!bug-mh (UUCP).

     Presently, there are two Internet discussion groups,
     MH-Users@ICS.UCI.EDU and MH-Workers@ICS.UCI.EDU.  MH-Workers is for peo-
     ple discussing code changes to _M_H.  MH-Users is for general discussion
     about how to use _M_H.  MH-Users is bi-directionally gatewayed into USENET
     as comp.mail.mh.

   HOW TO GET MH
     Since you probably already have _M_H, you may not need to read this unless
     you suspect you have an old version.  There are two ways to get the
     latest release:

     1.  If you can FTP to the ARPA Internet, use anonymous FTP to
     ics.uci.edu [128.195.1.1] and retrieve the file pub/mh/mh-6.7.tar.Z.
     This is a tar image after being run through the compress program


   [mh.6]                                                                   1






   MH-GEN(8)                                                               MH


     (approximately 1.5MB).  There should also be a README file in that
     directory which tells what the current release of _M_H is, and how to get
     updates.

     This tar file is also available on louie.udel.edu [128.175.1.3] in
     portal/mh-6.7.tar.Z.  You may also find MH on various other hosts; to
     make sure you get the latest version and don't waste your time re-fixing
     bugs, it's best to get it from either ics.uci.edu or louie.udel.edu.

     2.  You can send $75 US to the address below.  This covers the cost of a
     6250 BPI 9-track magtape, handling, and shipping.  In addition, you'll
     get a laser-printed hard-copy of the entire MH documentation set.  Be
     sure to include your USPS address with your check.  Checks must be drawn
     on U.S. funds and should be made payable to:

               Regents of the University of California

     The distribution address is:

               Computing Support Group
               Attn: MH distribution
               Department of Information and Computer Science
               University of California, Irvine
               Irvine, CA  92717

               714/856-7554

     Sadly, if you just want the hard-copies of the documentation, you still
     have to pay the $75.  The tar image has the documentation source (the
     manual is in roff format, but the rest are in TeX format).  Postscript
     formatted versions of the TeX papers are available, as are crude tty-
     conversions of those papers.

   SYNOPSIS
     MAKE

   DESCRIPTION
     This is a description of how one can bring up an _M_H system.  It is
     assumed that you have super-user privileges in order to (re-)install _M_H.
     Super-user privileges are not required to configure or generate _M_H.

     Become the super-user and create a new directory under /usr/src/local/
     (or whatever) for the _M_H area.  Traditionally, the directory's name
     should be mh/.  The distribution tape contains the hierarchy for the
     mh.6/ directory.  Bring the sources on-line:

     # mkdir /usr/src/local/mh
     % cd /usr/src/local/mh
     % tar xv

   CONFIGURATION
     First, go to the conf/ directory.

     % cd conf/


   2                                                                   [mh.6]






   MH                                                               MH-GEN(8)



     This directory contains files that will produce source files tailored
     for your choice of _M_H configuration.  You should edit only the file MH.
     This file contains configuration directives.  These configuration direc-
     tives are read by the _m_h_c_o_n_f_i_g program to produce customized files.  For
     examples of various configurations, look in the directory
     conf/examples/.  The file MH provided in conf/ is a reasonable default.

     Here are the _M_H configuration options available:
     bin: /usr/local
          The directory where user-invoked programs go (see manual section
          1).

     debug: off
          Support for debug mode of _M_H.  Don't use this unless you know what
          you're doing, which isn't likely if you're reading this document!

     etc: /usr/local/lib/mh
          The directory where pgm-invoked programs go (see manual section 8).

     mail: /usr/spool/mail
          The directory where the maildrops are stored.  If this pathname is
          absolute (i.e., begins with a / ), then the user's maildrop is a
          file called $USER in this directory.  If the pathname is not abso-
          lute, then the user's maildrop is in the user's home directory
          under the given name.

     mailgroup: off
          If set, _i_n_c is made set-group-id to this group name.  Some SYS5
          systems want this to be set to "mail".

     mandir: /usr/man
          The parent directory of the manual entries.

     manuals: standard
          Where manual entries should be installed, relative to the directory
          given with "mandir".  Either "local" to install manual entries
          under manl/, or "new" to install manual entries under mann/, or
          "old" to install manual entries under mano/, or "standard" to
          install manual entries under man?/, or "gen" to generate but not
          install them, or "none" to neither generate nor install them.  For
          example, to install manual entries under /usr/man/u_man/man?, use
          "standard" and /usr/man/u_man for "mandir".

     chown: /etc/chown
          The location of the _c_h_o_w_n (8) on your system.  If _c_h_o_w_n is in your
          search path, just use the value of "chown".  On SYS5 systems, this
          should probably be "/bin/chown".

     editor: prompter
          The default editor for _M_H.

     remove: mv -f
          How _M_H should backup existing files when installing a new file.


   [mh.6]                                                                   3






   MH-GEN(8)                                                               MH


     mts: sendmail
          Which message transport system to use.  Either "mmdf" to use _M_M_D_F
          as the transport system, "mmdf2" to use _M_M_D_F-_I_I as the transport
          system, "sendmail" to have _S_e_n_d_M_a_i_l as the transport system, or,
          "mh" to have _M_H as the transport system.

          On UNIX systems supporting TCP/IP networking via sockets you can
          add the suffix "/smtp" to the mts setting.  This often yields a
          superior interface as _M_H will post mail with the local _S_M_T_P server
          instead of interacting directly with _M_M_D_F or _S_e_n_d_M_a_i_l.  Hence, for
          TCP/IP UNIX systems, the "/smtp" suffix to either "sendmail" or
          "mmdf2" is the preferred MTS configuration.  The "/smtp" suffix is
          described in detail in the _A_d_m_i_n_i_s_t_r_a_t_o_r'_s _G_u_i_d_e; be sure to set
          "servers:" as described in _m_h-_t_a_i_l_o_r (8) if you use this option.

     bboards: off
          If "on", include support for the UCI BBoards facility.  BBoards may
          be enabled with any mts setting.  If "off", the BBoard reading pro-
          gram _b_b_c will not be installed.  If "nntp", include support for the
          UCI BBoards facility to read the Network News via the NNTP.  If
          "pop" (formerly "popbboards: on"), include support for the UCI
          BBoards facility via the POP3 service; this setting requires
          "pop: on".

     bbdelivery: off
          If "off", the BBoards delivery agent and library files will not be
          installed.  If "on", and you set "bboards:" to something besides
          "off", then the BBoards delivery agent and library files will be
          installed in the _b_b_h_o_m_e directory (see below).  To read remote
          BBoards, the usual configuration would have _b_b_c talk to a _P_O_P_3 or
          _N_N_T_P server.  However, it may be useful to set this to "off" if you
          NFS mount the _b_b_h_o_m_e directory from another host and want to use
          _b_b_c to read those files directly.

     bbhome: /usr/spool/bboards
          The home directory for the BBoards user.

     mf: off
          Support for mail filtering on those systems in which the message
          transport system isn't integrated with _U_U_C_P This option is strictly
          for an _M_H system using either _M_M_D_F-_I as its transport system or one
          using "stand-alone delivery".

     pop: off
          Support for POP service.  This allows local delivery for non-local
          users (a major win).  See support/pop/pop.rfc for more information
          on the POP.  This option currently works only on UNIX systems with
          TCP/IP sockets.  (It doesn't hurt to enable this option regardless
          of whether or not you intend to use POP.) If POP is enabled, there
          are three additional options which are of interest: "RPOP", "DPOP"
          and "POP2".  The first indicates that support for the UNIX variant
          of POP, RPOP, which uses privileged sockets for authentication be
          enabled.  This peacefully co-exists with the standard POP.  The
          "DPOP" option indicates that POP subscribers do not have entries in


   4                                                                   [mh.6]






   MH                                                               MH-GEN(8)


          the _p_a_s_s_w_d (5) file, and instead have their own separate database
          (another major win).  The "POP2" option indicates that the _M_H POP
          daemon should speak the older POP2 protocol in addition to the _M_H
          POP3 protocol - a major win.  All of these options can be enabled
          via an "options" directive in the _M_H configuration file.

     options:
          `-D' options to _c_c (1).  If you don't know what an option does, it
          probably doesn't apply to you.

          ALTOS
               Use on XENIX/v7 systems.  Also, be sure to use "options V7".

          ATHENA
               Makes _r_e_p_l `-nocc all' the default instead of `-cc all'.  You
               may want to enable this if you're using _x_m_h.

          ATZ
               Directs _M_H to use alpha-timezones whenever possible.

          BANG
               Directs _M_H to favor `!' over `@' in addressing.

          BERK
               Optional for for 4.{2,3}BSD sites running SendMail.  Disables
               nearly all of the RFC822 address and header-parsing routines
               in favor of recognizing such formats as ASCnet, and so on.  If
               you don't need to disable the parser for this reason, you
               probably want to use "options DUMB" instead.

          BIND
               If you are running with the BIND code on UNIX systems with
               TCP/IP sockets (e.g. 4.{2,3}BSD), be sure to define this.

          BSD41A
               Use on 4.1a Berkeley UNIX systems.

          BSD42
               Use on Berkeley UNIX systems on or after 4.2BSD.

          BSD43
               Use on 4.3 Berkeley UNIX systems.  Also, be sure to use
               "options BSD42".  If _o_p_e_n_l_o_g (3) (see "man 3 syslog") takes
               three arguments instead of two, and your _w_r_i_t_e (1) command is
               set-group-id to group "tty", use this option.  If only one of
               these conditions is true, you lose.

          COMPAT
               If you previously ran a version of _M_H earlier than mh.4 use
               this option.  After a short grace period, remove it and re-
               {configure,generate,install} everything.

          DBM
               Use this option if your _g_e_t_p_w_e_n_t (3) routines read a dbm


   [mh.6]                                                                   5






   MH-GEN(8)                                                               MH


               database (such as with Yellow Pages) instead of doing a
               sequential read of /etc/passwd.  Without DBM the entire passwd
               file is read into memory one entry at a time for alias expan-
               sion.  This is a performance improvement when reading a stan-
               dard /etc/passwd file, but is _v_e_r_y slow on systems with a dbm
               database.  At one site that runs YP on a large passwd file, it
               showed a 6:1 performance improvement.

          DPOP
               Enables the POP database, useful only if POP service is
               enabled.

          DUMB
               Directs _M_H not to try and rewrite addresses to their "offi-
               cial" form.

          FOLDPROT
               Defines the octal value for default folder-protection.  For
               example, FOLDPROT='"0700"'.  The default is "0711".

          ISI
               When using "repl -ccme", only "cc:" the first address found
               which belongs to the user; any other _A_l_t_e_r_n_a_t_e-_M_a_i_l_b_o_x_e_s do
               not receive "cc:"s.

          LINK
               Defines the filename for alternate file name for _d_i_s_t and
               _r_e_p_l.  For example, LINK='"\\043"' to use the pound-sign char-
               acter.  The default is "@".

          locname
               Hard-wires the local name for the host _M_H is running on.  For
               example, locname='"PICKLE"'.  It's probably better to either
               let UNIX tell _M_H this information, or to put the information
               in the host specific mtstailor file.

          MHE
               Enables crude support for Brien Reid's MHE interface.  Recom-
               mended for use with the GNU Emacs mh-e package.

          MHRC
               Enables _M_H to recognize the _C_S_h_e_l_l's `~'-construct.  This is
               useful for sites that run with a ~/.mhrc for their users.

          MORE
               Defines  the location of the _m_o_r_e (1) program.  For example,
               on ALTOS and DUAL systems, MORE='"/usr/bin/more"'.  The
               default is "/usr/ucb/more".

          MSGPROT
               Defines the octal value for default folder-protection For
               example, MSGPROT='"0600"'.  The default is "0644".

          NDIR


   6                                                                   [mh.6]






   MH                                                               MH-GEN(8)


               For non-Berkeley UNIX systems, this _M_H will try to find the
               new directory access mechanism by looking in <ndir.h> if this
               option is given.  Otherwise, _M_H will try <ndir.h>.  If you
               still can't get this to work on your system, edit h/local.h as
               appropriate.

          NFS
               Tells _M_H to hack around a problem in the NFS C library.  If
               you get an undefined symbol "ruserpass" when compiling _M_H, you
               need this option.

          NOIOCTLH
               Tells _M_H not to include the file <sys/ioctl.h>.  To be used on
               systems where this file is not present.

          NOMHSEQ
               Directs _M_H to make private sequences the default.

          NTOHLSWAP
               Tells _M_H to use the ntohl() macro when processing _m_s_h binary
               map files.  _M_H can use this macro on systems with the include
               file netinet/in.h, to byte-swap the binary information in
               these map files.  If you're using the same map files on
               machines of different architectures, enable this option.

          OVERHEAD
               Enable _M_H commands to read profile/context from open fd:s
               without doing an open(); see mh-profile(5) for the details.

          POP2
               Have the POP daemon understand the older POP2 protocol as well
               as the _M_H POP3 protocol - a major win.  The POP daemon auto-
               magically determines which POP protocol your client is using.
               If you're enabling POP service, there's no reason not to
               enable this option as well.  See also _P_O_P_S_E_R_V_I_C_E.

          POPSERVICE
               The port name the _M_H POP will use.  For historical reasons,
               this defaults to "pop".  In 1987, the _M_H POP protocol (POP
               version 3) was published as RFC1081 and was assigned its own
               port number (110), which differs from the original POP (ver-
               sion 1 and 2) port number (109).  To have _M_H POP use the new
               assigned port number, set POPSERVICE='"pop3"', and be sure
               that this service name is listed in your /etc/services file on
               both POP client and server hosts as "110/tcp".  If you enable
               _P_O_P_2, you can safely leave this undefined unless you are using
               POP3 clients besides _M_H.

          RPATHS
               Directs _i_n_c to note UNIX "From " lines as Return-Path: info.

          RPOP
               Enables the RPOP variant of POP, useful only if POP service is
               enabled.

          SBACKUP
               Defines the prefix string for backup file names.  For example,
               SBACKUP='"\\043"'.  The default is ",".

          SENDMAILBUG
               Causes SMTP reply code 451 (failure) to be considered the same
               as code 250 (OK).  Enable this if you know that your SendMail
               will return this code even when it doesn't mean to indicate a
               failure.

          SHADOW
               Indicates that the encrypted passwords can be found in the
               /etc/shadow file (and not in the /etc/passwd file).  This
               option should only be used for some (newer) SYSTEM 5 systems.

          SOCKETS
               Indicates the availability of a socket interface for TCP/IP
               networking that is compatible with 4.{2,3}BSD UNIX.  It is not
               necessary to define this when BSD42 is already defined, but it
               might be useful for SYSTEM 5 or HPUX systems with TCP/IP sock-
               ets.

          SUN40
               Use on Sun OS 4.0 (and later?) systems.  You probably also
               want "options BSD42", "options BSD43", and "options
               TYPESIG=void".

          SYS5
               Use on AT&T SYSTEM 5 R3 (and newer?) UNIX systems.  See also
               _m_a_i_l_g_r_o_u_p.

          SYS5DIR
               Define this if your system uses "struct dirent" instead of
               "struct direct".  This is true of System V Release 3.0 and
               later.  Uses include file <dirent.h> and the routines _m_k_d_i_r,
               _r_m_d_i_r and _g_e_t_c_w_d.

          TTYD
               Support for TTYD.  This is no longer in wide use, and is not
               recommended.

          TYPESIG
               Defines the base type (int or void) of the functions being
               parameter/return value of _s_i_g_n_a_l (2).  The default is int.
               Set TYPESIG='void' on systems which use this type (e.g., SYS-
               TEM 5 V3.0 and later or Sun OS 4.0).

          TZNAME
               Use time zone names from the _t_z_n_a_m_e variable, set via _t_z_s_e_t.
               Only applicable on SYSTEM 5 systems and only effective when
               you have asked for alpha-timezones (see the ATZ option).  See
               also ZONEINFO.

               First, "_" and "#" are recognized as the prefixes for scratch
               files.  Second, support for the UCI group-leadership mechanism
               is enabled in _c_o_n_f_l_i_c_t.  Third, the file $HOME/.signature is
               considered to contain a single line of text which is used as
               the _F_u_l_l _N_a_m_e part of your "From:" header.  This may conflict
               with the interpretation of this file by _N_e_w_s.  If you're not
               at UCI, you probably don't want this option.

          UK
               Directs the _s_c_a_n program to generate UK-style dates.

          V7
               Use on V7 UNIX systems.  Also, be sure to use "options
               void=int".

          WP
               Enables the White Pages service.  Contact wpp-manager@psi.com
               for more information.

          WHATNOW
               Enable certain _M_H commands to act differently when $mhdraft
               set.

          ZONEINFO
               Specify this if you have a BSD43 based system that keeps time
               zone information /etc/zoneinfo or /usr/lib/zoneinfo (SunOS).
               With this fix the GMT offset specified in outgoing mail will
               be corrected when the TZ enviornment variable is set to a dif-
               ferent time zone.  See also TZNAME.

     cc:
          The name of your C compiler, if not "cc".

     ccoptions: -O
          Options given directly to _c_c (1).  The most common is "-M" if
          you're running _M_H on an ALTOS.  This defaults to "-O".  If you
          define this and want to keep "-O", be sure to include it expli-
          citly.

     curses: -lcurses -ltermlib
          This should be the loader option required to load the _t_e_r_m_c_a_p (3)
          and _c_u_r_s_e_s (3) libraries on your system.  On SYS5 systems, it prob-
          ably should be just "-lcurses".  Some sites have reported that both
          "-lcurses" and "-ltermlib" are necessary.

     ldoptions:
          Options given directly to _l_d (1) (via _c_c ) at the beginning of the
          command line.  Useful for machines which require arguments to tell
          _l_d to increase the stack space (e.g. the Gould, which uses "-m 8").
          Usually, "-s" is a good choice in any event.

     ldoptlibs:
          Options given directly to _l_d (1) (via _c_c ) at the end of the com-
          mand line.  The two most common are: "-ldbm" if you're running MMDF


   [mh.6]                                                                   9

          with the _d_b_m package; and, "-lndir" if you are generating _M_H on a
          system which does not load the new directory access mechanism by
          default (e.g., 4.1BSD, SYS5).  If you don't have _l_i_b_n_d_i_r on your
          system, the sources are in miscellany/libndir/.

     lex: lex -nt
          Alternative version of _l_e_x.  Used in zotnet/tws/.

     sprintf: int
          The return value of the _s_p_r_i_n_t_f library routine.  This defaults to
          "char *".  Set this to "int" if you have an older version of SYSTEM
          5 which has this routine return an "int" type.

     sharedlib: off
          Makes libmh.a into a shared library (only for SunOS 4.0 and later).
          If you enable this, be sure to use "options SUN40".

     slibdir: /usr/local/lib
          The directory where the MH shared library should go.  You'll need
          to manually run _l_d_c_o_n_f_i_g (8) whenever a new shared object is
          installed on the system.

          If you want to put it somewhere other than /usr/lib or
          /usr/local/lib (not advisable), you'll probably have to run _l_d_c_o_n_-
          _f_i_g (8) on that directory, or alter the environment variable
          LD_LIBRARY_PATH for each user wishing to use the MH system (this is
          messy). See _l_d (1) for more information about how to do this.

     oldload: off
          Support for the ALTOS loader if "on".  Support for loaders not han-
          dling `-x -r' correctly if "none".

     ranlib: on
          Support for systems with _r_a_n_l_i_b (1).  For SYSTEM 5 systems, this
          should be "off" which tells _M_H to use _l_o_r_d_e_r and _t_s_o_r_t instead.
          Some SYSTEM 5 sites reported that running this isn't always suffi-
          cient.  If this is the case, then you should edit
          conf/makefiles/uip to include ../sbr/libmh.a and ../zotnet/libzot.a
          twice in the LIBES variable.

     tma: off
          Support for the TTI _t_r_u_s_t_e_d _m_a_i_l _a_g_e_n_t (TMA).  Although the TTI TMA
          is not in the public domain, the _M_H support for the TTI TMA is in
          the public domain.  You should enable this option only if you are
          licensed to run the TMA software (otherwise, you don't have the
          software in your _M_H source tree).

     Now edit conf/config/mtstailor, depending on your choice of the setting
     for mts in the _M_H configuration file.  for an mts setting of "mh", look
     at the file conf/tailor/mhmts; for an mts setting of "sendmail",
     "sendmail/smtp", "mmdf/smtp", or "mmdf2/smtp", look at the file
     conf/tailor/sendmts; and, for an mts setting of "mmdf", or  "mmdf2",
     look at the file conf/tailor/mmdf.

     Now install the configured files into the source areas.  (On SYSTEM 5
     systems you may need to use "make sys5" to compile mhconfig.)

     % make
     % ./mhconfig MH

     You now proceed based on your choice of a transport system (the setting
     for mts above).  The best interface is achieved with "sendmail" followed
     by "mmdf" or ("mmdf2"), and then "mh" (stand-alone delivery, not recom-
     mended).

     SENDMAIL

     If you want _S_e_n_d_M_a_i_l to transport messages for _M_H, then go to the
     mts/sendmail/ directory.

     % cd ../mts/sendmail/

     This directory contains files whose definitions correspond to the confi-
     guration of your _S_e_n_d_M_a_i_l system.  If you have enabled BBoards or POP
     service, then you will need to re-configure _S_e_n_d_M_a_i_l.  First, in the
     "local info" section of your site's _S_e_n_d_M_a_i_l configuration file, choose
     a free macro/class (B is used in this distribution), and add these
     lines:

          # BBoards support
          DBbboards
          CBbboards

     Second, immediately after the inclusion of the zerobase file, in the
     "machine dependent part of ruleset zero" section, add these lines:

          # resolve names for the BBoards system
          R$+<@$=B>      $#bboards$@$2$:$1        topic@bboards

     Be sure to use tabs when separating these fields.  Third, add the line

          include(bboardsMH.m4)

     after the line

          include(localm.m4)

     in your site's _S_e_n_d_M_a_i_l configuration file.  Finally, you should link
     the file mts/sendmail/bboardsMH.m4 into your _S_e_n_d_M_a_i_l cf/ directory and
     re-configure _S_e_n_d_M_a_i_l.

     If you have enabled POP service, a similar procedure must be used on the
     POP service host, to re-configure _S_e_n_d_M_a_i_l.  First, in the "local info"
     section of your site's _S_e_n_d_M_a_i_l configuration file, choose a free
     macro/class (P is used in this distribution), and add these lines:

          # POP support
          DPpop


   [mh.6]                                                                  11

          CPpop

     Second, immediately after the inclusion of the zerobase file, in the
     "machine dependent part of ruleset zero" section, add these lines:

          # resolve names for the POP system
          R$+<@$=P>      $#pop$@$2$:$1            subscriber@pop

     Be sure to use tabs when separating these fields.  Third, add the line

          include(popMH.m4)

     after the line

          include(localm.m4)

     in your site's _S_e_n_d_M_a_i_l configuration file.  Finally, you should link
     the file mts/sendmail/popMH.m4 into your _S_e_n_d_M_a_i_l cf/ directory and
     re-configure _S_e_n_d_M_a_i_l.

     MMDF

     If you want _M_M_D_F to be your transport service, and have NOT specified
     "mmdf/smtp" (or "mmdf2/smtp") as your mts setting, then go to the mmdf/
     directory.  (If you're using "mmdf/smtp" or "mmdf2/smtp" as your mts
     setting, then skip to the next section.)

     % cd ../mts/mmdf/

     This directory contains files whose definitions correspond to the confi-
     guration of your _M_M_D_F system.

     If you're running _M_M_D_F-_I, then copy the following files from wherever
     you keep the _M_M_D_F sources to this directory: mmdf/h/ch.h, mmdf/h/conf.h,
     utildir/conf_util.h, utildir/ll_log.h, mmdf/h/mmdf.h, utildir/util.h,
     mmdf/mmdf_lib.a, and utildir/util_lib.a.

     If you're running _M_M_D_F-_I_I, then copy the following files from where you
     keep the _M_M_D_F sources to this directory: h/ch.h, h/conf.h, h/dm.h,
     h/ll_log.h, h/mmdf.h, h/util.h, and lib/libmmdf.a

     If you have enabled bboards, then the directories support/bboards/mmdfI
     and support/bboards/mmdfII contain information you'll need to put a UCI
     BBoards channel in your _M_M_D_F configuration.  Similarly, if you have
     enabled option "mf" and are running _M_M_D_F-_I, then the zotnet/mf/mmdfI/
     directory contains information you'll need to put a _U_U_C_P channel in your
     _M_M_D_F-_I configuration.  Finally, the directory support/pop/mmdfII con-
     tains information you'll need to put a POP channel in your _M_M_D_F-_I_I con-
     figuration.

     Note that _M_M_D_F-_I_I is distributed with the BBoards channel, although the
     version in the _M_H distribution might be more current, the version in the
     _M_M_D_F-_I_I distribution has been tested with that revision of _M_M_D_F.

     MMDF/SMTP

     If you are using "mmdf/smtp" as your mts setting, then no further
     MTS-specific action is required on your part!

     MMDF2/SMTP

     If you are using "mmdf2/smtp" as your mts setting, then no futher
     MTS-specific action is required on your part!

     STAND-ALONE DELIVERY

     If, instead, you want _M_H to handle its own mail delivery, then no futher
     MTS-specific action is required on your part!

   GENERATION
     Go to the mh.6/ directory and generate the system.

     % cd ../; make

     This will cause a complete generation of the _M_H system.  If all goes
     well, proceed with installation.  If not, complain, as there "should be
     no problems" at this step.

   INSTALLATION
     If the directories you chose for the user-programs and support-programs
     ("bin" and "etc" in the conf/MH file) don't exist, you should create
     them at this point.

     Before proceeding, you should familiarize yourself with the
     _A_d_m_i_n_i_s_t_r_a_t_o_r'_s _G_u_i_d_e.  To generate an _n_r_o_f_f version, go to the doc/
     directory and type:

     % (cd doc/; make ADMIN.doc)

     To generate a _t_r_o_f_f version, type

     % (cd doc/; make guide)

     instead.

     If you're already running _M_H at your site, you should also read the _m_h._6
     changes documents.  The sources are in papers/mh6.5/ and papers/mh6.7/.

     Next, if you enabled support for the UCI BBoards facility, then create a
     login called "bboards" with the following characteristics: home direc-
     tory is /usr/spool/bboards/ with mode 755 (actually, use the value for
     "bbhome" given in the _M_H configuration file), login shell is /bin/csh
     (or /bin/sh), and, encrypted password field is "*".  The "bboards" login
     should own the /usr/spool/bboards/ directory.  In addition to creating
     /usr/spool/bboards/, also create /usr/spool/bboards/etc/ and
     /usr/spool/bboards/archive/.  These directories should also be owned by

     If you enabled support for POP, then on the POP service host, create a
     login called "pop" with the following characteristics: home directory is
     /usr/spool/pop/ with mode 755, login shell is /bin/csh, and, encrypted
     password field is "*".  If you don't have /bin/csh on your system (V7),
     then /bin/sh is just fine.  The "pop" login should own the
     /usr/spool/pop/ directory.  You'll also need to add a line to the
     /etc/services file and the /etc/rc.local file, see the _A_d_m_i_n_i_s_t_r_a_t_o_r'_s
     _G_u_i_d_e  for more details.

     If this is not the first time you have installed _M_H, these files will
     need particular attention:

          _D_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y                 _F_i_l_e_s
          "etc/"                    MailAliases, BBoardAliases, mtstailor
          /usr/spool/bboards/       BBoards, .cshrc, .mh_profile
          /usr/spool/bboards/etc/   *

     The MailAliases, BBoardAliases, mtstailor and BBoards files will not be
     installed over existing copies; you will need to edit these by hand and
     merge in any changes from your previous _M_H release.  The other files
     under /usr/spool/bboards/ will be overwritten if they exist.  You may
     wish to preserve your old versions of these before installing _M_H.

     As the super-user, and from the mh.6/ directory, install the system.

     # make inst-all

     This will cause the _M_H processes and files to be transferred to the
     appropriate areas with the appropriate attributes.

   TAILORING
     See the _A_d_m_i_n_i_s_t_r_a_t_o_r'_s _G_u_i_d_e for information on tailoring _M_H for the
     MTS, BBoards, and POP.

   DOCUMENTATION
     In addition to this document, the administrator's guide, and the user's
     manual, there are several documents referenced by the user's manual
     which may be useful.  The sources for all of these can be found under
     the papers/ directory.

   OTHER THINGS
     Consult the directory miscellany/ for the sources to a number of things
     which aren't part of the mainstream _M_H distribution, but which are still
     quite useful.

   FILES
     Too numerous to mention.  Really.

   BUGS
     The _m_h_c_o_n_f_i_g program should be smarter.

     The Makefiles should know when _m_h_c_o_n_f_i_g has been run and force "make
     clean" behavior.
