.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIConflict\fR is a program that checks to see if the interface between
\fIMH\fR and transport system is in good shape

\fIConflict\fR
also checks for maildrops in /usr/spool/mail which do not belong
to a valid user.
It assumes that no user name will start with `.',
and thus ignores files in /usr/spool/mail which begin with `.'.
It also checks for entries in the \fIgroup\fR\0(5)
file which do not belong to a valid user,
and for users who do not have a valid group number.
In addition duplicate users and groups are noted.

If the `\-mail\ name' switch is used,
then the results will be sent to the specified \fIname\fR.
Otherwise, the results are sent to the standard output.

The `\-search\ directory' switch can be used to search directories
other than /usr/spool/mail and to report anomalies in those directories.
The `\-search\ directory' switch can appear more than one time in an
invocation to \fIconflict\fR.

\fIConflict\fR should be run under  \fIcron\fR\0(8),
or whenever system accounting takes place.
