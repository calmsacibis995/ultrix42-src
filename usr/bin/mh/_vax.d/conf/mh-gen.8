.SH "READ THIS"
This documentation describes how to configure, generate, and install
the UCI version of the RAND \fIMH\fR system.  \fBBe certain\fP to 
read this document completely before you begin.  You probably will
also want to familiarize yourself with the \fIMH\fP Administrator's
Guide before you install \fIMH\fP.
.SH DISCLAIMER
Although the \fIMH\fR system was originally developed by the RAND Corporation,
and is now in the public domain,
the RAND Corporation assumes no responsibility for \fIMH\fR
or this particular modification of \fIMH\fR.
.PP
In addition,
the Regents of the University of California issue the following
\fBdisclaimer\fR in regard to the UCI version of \fIMH\fR:
.in +.5i
\*(lqAlthough each program has been tested by its contributor,
no warranty, express or implied,
is made by the contributor or the University of California,
as to the accuracy and functioning of the program
and related program material,
nor shall the fact of distribution constitute any such warranty,
and no responsibility is assumed by the contributor
or the University of California in connection herewith.\*(rq
.in -.5i
.PP
This version of \fIMH\fR is in the public domain,
and as such,
there are no real restrictions on its use.
The \fIMH\fR source code and documentation have no licensing restrictions
whatsoever.
As a courtesy,
the authors ask only that you provide appropriate credit to the RAND
Corporation and
the University of California for having developed the software.
.SH "GETTING HELP"
\fIMH\fR is a software package that is neither supported by the RAND
Corporation nor the University of California.
However,
since we do use the software ourselves and plan to continue using (and
improving) \fIMH\fR,
bug reports and their associated fixes should be reported back to us so that
we may include them in future releases.
The current computer mailbox for \fIMH\fR is \fBBug\-MH@ICS.UCI.EDU\fR
(in the ARPA Internet),
and \fB...!ucbvax!ucivax!bug\-mh\fR (UUCP).
.PP
Presently,
there are two Internet discussion groups, \fBMH\-Users@ICS.UCI.EDU\fR
and \fBMH\-Workers@ICS.UCI.EDU\fR.  \fBMH\-Workers\fP is for people
discussing code changes to \fIMH\fP.  \fBMH-Users\fP is for general
discussion about how to use \fIMH\fP.
\fBMH\-Users\fR is bi-directionally 
gatewayed into USENET as \fBcomp.mail.mh\fR.
.SH "HOW TO GET MH"
Since you probably already have \fIMH\fP,
you may not need to read this unless you suspect you have an old version.
There are two ways to get the latest release:
.PP
1.  If you can FTP to the ARPA Internet, use anonymous FTP to
ics.uci.edu [128.195.1.1] and retrieve the file pub/mh/mh-6.7.tar.Z.
This is a tar image after being run through the compress program
(approximately 1.5MB).  There should also be a \fBREADME\fR file in
that directory which tells what the current release of \fIMH\fP
is, and how to get updates.
.PP
This tar file is also available on louie.udel.edu 
[128.175.1.3] in portal/mh-6.7.tar.Z.  You may also find MH on
various other hosts; to make sure you get the latest version and
don't waste your time re-fixing bugs, it's best to get it from
either ics.uci.edu or louie.udel.edu.
.PP
2.  You can send $75 US to the address below.
This covers the cost of a 6250 BPI 9-track magtape,
handling, and shipping.  In addition, you'll get a
laser-printed hard-copy of the entire MH documentation set.  Be
sure to include your USPS address with your check.  Checks 
must be drawn on U.S\&. funds and should be made payable to:

Sadly, if you just want the hard-copies of the documentation, you
still have to pay the $75.  The tar image has the documentation
source (the manual is in roff format, but the rest are in TeX
format).  Postscript formatted versions of the TeX papers are 
available, as are crude tty-conversions of those papers.
.SH SYNOPSIS
MAKE
.SH DESCRIPTION
This is a description of how one can bring up an \fIMH\fR system.
It is assumed that you have super-user privileges in order to
(re\-)install \fIMH\fR.
Super-user privileges are not required to configure or generate \fIMH\fR.
.PP
Become the super-user and create a new directory under /usr/src/local/
(or whatever) for the \fIMH\fR area.
Traditionally, the directory's name should be mh/.
The distribution tape contains the hierarchy for the mh.6/ directory.
Bring the sources on-line:
.sp 1
.nf
# mkdir /usr/src/local/mh
% cd /usr/src/local/mh
% tar xv
.fi
.SH CONFIGURATION
First, go to the conf/ directory.
.sp 1
.nf
% cd conf/
.fi
.sp 1
This directory contains files that will produce source files tailored
for your choice of \fIMH\fR configuration.
You should edit only the file \fBMH\fR.
This file contains configuration directives.
These configuration directives are read by the \fImhconfig\fR program to
produce customized files.
For examples of various configurations,
look in the directory \fBconf/examples/\fR.
The file \fBMH\fR provided in \fBconf/\fR is a reasonable default.
.PP
Here are the \fIMH\fP configuration options available:
.in +.5i
.ti -.5i
bin: /usr/local
.br
The directory where user\-invoked programs go (see manual section 1).

.ti -.5i
debug: off
.br
Support for debug mode of \fIMH\fR.
Don't use this unless you know what you're doing,
which isn't likely if you're reading this document!

.ti -.5i
etc: /usr/local/lib/mh
.br
The directory where pgm\-invoked programs go (see manual section 8).

.ti -.5i
mail: /usr/spool/mail
.br
The directory where the maildrops are stored.
If this pathname is absolute (i.e., begins with a \fB/\fR\0),
then the user's maildrop is a file called \fB$USER\fR in this directory.
If the pathname is not absolute,
then the user's maildrop is in the user's home directory under the given name.

.ti -.5i
mailgroup: off
.br
If set, \fIinc\fR is made set-group-id to this group name.
Some SYS5 systems want this to be set to \*(lqmail\*(rq.

.ti -.5i
mandir: /usr/man
.br
The parent directory of the manual entries.

.ti -.5i
manuals: standard
.br
Where manual entries should be installed,
relative to the directory given with \*(lqmandir\*(rq.
Either \*(lqlocal\*(rq to install manual entries under \fBmanl/\fR,
or \*(lqnew\*(rq to install manual entries under \fBmann/\fR,
or \*(lqold\*(rq to install manual entries under \fBmano/\fR,
or \*(lqstandard\*(rq to install manual entries under \fBman?/\fR,
or \*(lqgen\*(rq to generate but not install them,
or \*(lqnone\*(rq to neither generate nor install them.
For example,
to install manual entries under \fB/usr/man/u_man/man?\fR,
use \*(lqstandard\*(rq and \fB/usr/man/u_man\fR for \*(lqmandir\*(rq.

.ti -.5i
chown: /etc/chown
.br
The location of the \fIchown\fR\0(8) on your system.
If \fIchown\fR is in your search path,
just use the value of \*(lqchown\*(rq.
On SYS5 systems,
this should probably be \*(lq/bin/chown\*(rq.

.ti -.5i
editor: prompter
.br
The default editor for \fIMH\fR.

.ti -.5i
remove: mv \-f
.br
How \fIMH\fR should backup existing files when installing a new file.

.ti -.5i
mts: sendmail
.br
Which message transport system to use.
Either \*(lqmmdf\*(rq to use \fIMMDF\fR as the transport system,
\*(lqmmdf2\*(rq to use \fIMMDF\-II\fR as the transport system,
\*(lqsendmail\*(rq to have \fISendMail\fR as the transport system,
or, \*(lqmh\*(rq to have \fIMH\fR as the transport system.

On UNIX systems supporting TCP/IP networking via sockets
you can add the suffix \*(lq/smtp\*(rq to the mts setting.
This often yields a superior interface as \fIMH\fR will post mail with the
local \fISMTP\fR server instead of interacting directly with \fIMMDF\fR or
\fISendMail\fR.
Hence, for TCP/IP UNIX systems,
the \*(lq/smtp\*(rq suffix to either \*(lqsendmail\*(rq or \*(lqmmdf2\*(rq is
the preferred MTS configuration.
The \*(lq/smtp\*(rq suffix is described in detail in the \fIAdministrator's
Guide\fR; be sure to set \*(lqservers:\*(rq as described in
\fImh\-tailor\fR\0(8) if you use this option.

.ti -.5i
bboards: off
.br
If \*(lqon\*(rq, include support for the UCI BBoards facility.
BBoards may be enabled with any mts setting.
If \*(lqoff\*(rq, the BBoard reading program \fIbbc\fR will not be installed.
If \*(lqnntp\*(rq,
include support for the UCI BBoards facility to read the Network News
via the NNTP.
If \*(lqpop\*(rq (formerly \*(lqpopbboards:\ on\*(rq),
include support for the UCI BBoards facility via the POP3 service;
this setting requires \*(lqpop:\ on\*(rq.

.ti -.5i
bbdelivery: off
.br
If \*(lqoff\*(rq,
the BBoards delivery agent and library files will not be installed.
If 
\*(lqon\*(rq,
and you set \*(lqbboards:\*(rq to something besides \*(lqoff\*(rq,
then 
the BBoards delivery agent and library files will be installed
in the \fIbbhome\fR directory (see below).
To read remote BBoards,
the usual configuration would have \fIbbc\fR talk to a \fIPOP3\fR or
\fINNTP\fR server.
However, it may be useful to set this to \*(lqoff\*(rq if 
you NFS mount the \fIbbhome\fR directory from another host
and want to use \fIbbc\fR to read those files directly.

.ti -.5i
bbhome: /usr/spool/bboards
.br
The home directory for the BBoards user.

.ti -.5i
mf: off
.br
Support for mail filtering on those systems in which the message transport
system isn't integrated with \fIUUCP\fR 
This option is strictly for an \fIMH\fR system using either \fIMMDF\-I\fR
as its transport system or one using \*(lqstand\-alone delivery\*(rq.

.ti -.5i
pop: off
.br
Support for POP service.
This allows local delivery for non\-local users
(a major win).
See \fBsupport/pop/pop.rfc\fR for more information on the POP.
This option currently works only on UNIX systems with TCP/IP sockets.
(It doesn't hurt to enable this option regardless of whether or not
you intend to use POP.)
If POP is enabled, there are three additional options which are of interest:
\*(lqRPOP\*(rq, \*(lqDPOP\*(rq and \*(lqPOP2\*(rq.
The first indicates that support for the UNIX variant of POP,
RPOP, which uses privileged sockets for authentication be enabled.
This peacefully co\-exists with the standard POP.
The \*(lqDPOP\*(rq option indicates that POP subscribers do not have
entries in the \fIpasswd\fR\0(5) file,
and instead have their own separate database (another major win).
The \*(lqPOP2\*(rq option indicates that the \fIMH\fP POP daemon should
speak the older POP2 protocol in addition to the \fIMH\fP POP3 protocol \-
a major win.
All of these options can be enabled via an \*(lqoptions\*(rq directive in the
\fIMH\fR configuration file.

.ti -.5i
options:
.br
\&`\-D' options to \fIcc\fR\0(1).  If you don't know what an
option does, it probably doesn't apply to you.

.in +.5i
.ti -.5i
ALTOS
.br
Use on XENIX/v7 systems.
Also, be sure to use \*(lqoptions V7\*(rq.

.ti -.5i
ATHENA
.br
Makes \fIrepl\fR `\-nocc\ all' the default instead of `\-cc\ all'.
You may want to enable this if you're using \fIxmh\fR.

.ti -.5i
ATZ
.br
Directs \fIMH\fR to use alpha\-timezones whenever possible.

.ti -.5i
BANG
.br
Directs \fIMH\fR to favor `!' over `@' in addressing.

.ti -.5i
BERK
.br
Optional for for 4.{2,3}BSD sites running SendMail.
Disables nearly all of the RFC822 address and header-parsing routines
in favor of recognizing such formats as ASCnet, and so on.
If you don't need to disable the parser for this reason,
you probably want to use \*(lqoptions DUMB\*(rq instead.

.ti -.5i
BIND
.br
If you are running with the BIND code on UNIX systems
with TCP/IP sockets (e.g. 4.{2,3}BSD),
be sure to define this.

.ti -.5i
BSD41A
.br
Use on 4.1a Berkeley UNIX systems.

.ti -.5i
BSD42
.br
Use on Berkeley UNIX systems on or after 4.2BSD.

.ti -.5i
BSD43
.br
Use on 4.3 Berkeley UNIX systems.
Also, be sure to use \*(lqoptions BSD42\*(rq.
If \fIopenlog\fR\0(3) (see \*(lqman 3 syslog\*(rq)
takes three arguments instead of two,
and your \fIwrite\fR\0(1) command is set\-group\-id
to group \*(lqtty\*(rq, use this option.
If only one of these conditions is true, you lose.

.ti -.5i
COMPAT
.br
If you previously ran a version of \fIMH\fR earlier than mh.4 use this option.
After a short grace period,
remove it and re-{configure,generate,install} everything.

.ti -.5i
DBM
.br
Use this option if your \fIgetpwent\fR\0(3) routines read a 
dbm database (such as with Yellow Pages) instead of doing
a sequential read of \fB/etc/passwd\fR.
Without DBM the entire passwd file is read into
memory one entry at a time for alias expansion.
This is a performance improvement when reading
a standard \fB/etc/passwd\fR file,
but is \fIvery\fR slow on systems with a dbm database.
At one site that runs
YP on a large passwd file, it showed a 6:1 performance improvement.

.ti -.5i
DPOP
.br
Enables the POP database, useful only if POP service is enabled.

.ti -.5i
DUMB
.br
Directs \fIMH\fR not to try and rewrite addresses to their 
\*(lqofficial\*(rq form.

.ti -.5i
FOLDPROT
.br
Defines the octal value for default folder-protection.
For example, FOLDPROT='\*(lq0700\*(rq'.
The default is \*(lq0711\*(rq.

.ti -.5i
ISI
.br
When using \*(lqrepl\ \-ccme\*(rq,
only \*(lqcc:\*(rq the first address found which belongs to the user;
any other \fIAlternate-Mailboxes\fR do not receive \*(lqcc:\*(rqs.

.ti -.5i
LINK
.br
Defines the filename for alternate file name for \fIdist\fR and \fIrepl\fR.
For example, LINK='\*(lq\\\\043\*(rq' to use the pound\-sign character.
The default is \*(lq@\*(rq.

.ti -.5i
locname
.br
Hard\-wires the local name for the host \fIMH\fR is running on.
For example, locname='\*(lqPICKLE\*(rq'.
It's probably better to either let UNIX tell \fIMH\fR this information,
or to put the information in the host specific \fBmtstailor\fR file.

.ti -.5i
MHE
.br
Enables crude support for Brien Reid's MHE interface.
Recommended for use with the GNU Emacs mh-e package.

.ti -.5i
MHRC
.br
Enables \fIMH\fR to recognize the \fICShell\fR's `~'\-construct.
This is useful for sites that run with a ~/.mhrc for their users.

.ti -.5i
MORE
.br
Defines  the location of the \fImore\fR\0(1) program.
For example, on ALTOS and DUAL systems,
MORE='\*(lq/usr/bin/more\*(rq'.
The default is \*(lq/usr/ucb/more\*(rq.

.ti -.5i
MSGPROT
.br
Defines the octal value for default folder-protection
For example, MSGPROT='\*(lq0600\*(rq'.
The default is \*(lq0644\*(rq.

.ti -.5i
NDIR
.br
For non-Berkeley UNIX systems,
this \fIMH\fR will try to find the new directory access mechanism by looking
in \fB<ndir.h>\fR if this option is given.
Otherwise, \fIMH\fR will try \fB<ndir.h>\fR.
If you still can't get this to work on your system,
edit \fBh/local.h\fR as appropriate.

.ti -.5i
NFS
.br
Tells \fIMH\fR to hack around a problem in the NFS C library.
If you get an undefined symbol \*(lqruserpass\*(rq when compiling
\fIMH\fP, you need this option.

.ti -.5i
NOIOCTLH
.br
Tells \fIMH\fR not to include the file \fB<sys/ioctl.h>\fR.
To be used on systems where this file is not present.

.ti -.5i
NOMHSEQ
.br
Directs \fIMH\fR to make private sequences the default.

.ti -.5i
NTOHLSWAP
.br
Tells \fIMH\fR to use the \fBntohl()\fR macro when processing
\fImsh\fR binary map files.  \fIMH\fR can use this macro on
systems with the include file \fBnetinet/in.h\fR,
to byte-swap the binary information in these map files.
If you're using the same map files on machines of different
architectures, enable this option.

.ti -.5i
OVERHEAD
.br
Enable \fIMH\fR commands to read profile/context from open fd:s
without doing an open(); see mh-profile(5) for the details.

.ti -.5i
POP2
.br
Have the POP daemon understand the older
POP2 protocol as well as the \fIMH\fP POP3 protocol \- a major win.
The POP daemon auto-magically
determines which POP protocol your client is using.
If you're enabling POP service,
there's no reason not to enable this option as well.
See also \fIPOPSERVICE\fR.

.ti -.5i
POPSERVICE
.br
The port name the \fIMH\fP POP will use.  For historical reasons,
this defaults to \*(lqpop\*(rq.
In 1987, the \fIMH\fP POP protocol
(POP version 3) was published as RFC1081 and
was assigned its own port number (110),
which differs from the original POP (version 1 and 2) port number (109).
To have \fIMH\fP POP use the new assigned port number, 
set POPSERVICE='\*(lqpop3\*(rq', and be sure that this service
name is listed in your \fB/etc/services\fP file on both POP client
and server hosts as \*(lq110/tcp\*(rq.
If you enable \fIPOP2\fP, you can safely leave this undefined unless
you are using POP3 clients besides \fIMH\fP.

.ti -.5i
RPATHS
.br
Directs \fIinc\fR to note UNIX \*(lqFrom\ \*(rq lines as Return-Path: info.

.ti -.5i
RPOP
.br
Enables the RPOP variant of POP, useful only if POP service is enabled.

.ti -.5i
SBACKUP
.br
Defines the prefix string for backup file names.
For example, SBACKUP='\*(lq\\\\043\*(rq'.
The default is \*(lq,\*(rq.

.ti -.5i
SENDMAILBUG
.br
Causes SMTP reply code 451 (failure)
to be considered the same as code 250 (OK).
Enable this if you know that your SendMail will
return this code even when it doesn't mean to indicate a failure.

.ti -.5i
SHADOW
.br
Indicates that the encrypted passwords can be found in the
\fB/etc/shadow\fR file (and not in the \fB/etc/passwd\fR file).
This option should only be used for some (newer) SYSTEM 5 systems.

.ti -.5i
SOCKETS
.br
Indicates the availability of a socket interface
for TCP/IP networking that is compatible with 4.{2,3}BSD UNIX.
It is not necessary to define this when BSD42 is already defined,
but it might be useful for SYSTEM 5 or HPUX systems with TCP/IP sockets.

.ti -.5i
SUN40
.br
Use on Sun OS 4.0 (and later?) systems.  You probably also want
\*(lqoptions BSD42\*(rq, \*(lqoptions BSD43\*(rq, and
\*(lqoptions TYPESIG=void\*(rq.

.ti -.5i
SYS5
.br
Use on AT&T SYSTEM 5 R3 (and newer?) UNIX systems.  See also \fImailgroup\fR.

.ti -.5i
SYS5DIR
.br
Define this if your system uses \*(lqstruct dirent\*(rq
instead of \*(lqstruct direct\*(rq.
This is true of System V Release 3.0 and later.
Uses include file \fB<dirent.h>\fR
and the routines \fImkdir\fR, \fIrmdir\fR and \fIgetcwd\fR.

.ti -.5i
TTYD
.br
Support for TTYD.  This is no longer in wide use, and is not recommended.

.ti -.5i
TYPESIG
.br
Defines the base type (int or void) of the functions
being parameter/return value of \fIsignal\fR\0(2).
The default is \fBint\fR.
Set TYPESIG='void' on systems which use this type
(e.g., SYSTEM 5 V3.0 and later or Sun OS 4.0).

.ti -.5i
TZNAME
.br
Use time zone names from the \fItzname\fR variable, set via \fItzset\fR.
Only applicable on SYSTEM 5 systems and only effective when you have
asked for alpha\-timezones (see the ATZ option).  See also ZONEINFO.

.ti -.5i
UCI
.br
First, \*(lq_\*(rq and \*(lq#\*(rq are recognized as the prefixes for
scratch files.
Second, support for the UCI group\-leadership mechanism is enabled in
\fIconflict\fR.
Third, the file \fB$HOME/.signature\fR is considered to contain 
a single line of text which is used as the \fIFull Name\fR part
of your \*(lqFrom:\*(rq header.
This may conflict with the interpretation of this file by \fINews\fR.
If you're not at UCI, you probably don't want this option.

.ti -.5i
UK
.br
Directs the \fIscan\fR program to generate UK-style dates.

.ti -.5i
V7
.br
Use on V7 UNIX systems.
Also, be sure to use \*(lqoptions void=int\*(rq.

.ti -.5i
WP
.br
Enables the White Pages service.
Contact wpp-manager@psi.com for more information.

.ti -.5i
WHATNOW
.br
Enable certain \fIMH\fR commands to act differently when $mhdraft set.

.ti -.5i
ZONEINFO
.br
Specify this if you have a BSD43 based system that keeps time zone
information /etc/zoneinfo or /usr/lib/zoneinfo (SunOS).
With this fix the GMT offset specified in outgoing mail
will be corrected when the TZ enviornment variable is set
to a different time zone.  See also TZNAME.
.in -.5i

.ti -.5i
cc:
.br
The name of your C compiler, if not \*(lqcc\*(rq.

.ti -.5i
ccoptions: \-O
.br
Options given directly to \fIcc\fR\0(1).
The most common is \*(lq\-M\*(rq if you're running \fIMH\fR on an ALTOS.
This defaults to \*(lq\-O\*(rq.  If you define this and want to 
keep \*(lq\-O\*(rq, be sure to include it explicitly.

.ti -.5i
curses: \-lcurses\0\-ltermlib
.br
This should be the loader option required to load the \fItermcap\fR\0(3)
and \fIcurses\fR\0(3) libraries on your system.
On SYS5 systems, it probably should be just \*(lq\-lcurses\*(rq.
Some sites have reported that both \*(lq\-lcurses\*(rq and
\*(lq\-ltermlib\*(rq are necessary.

.ti -.5i
ldoptions:
.br
Options given directly to \fIld\fR\0(1) (via \fIcc\fR\0) at the beginning
of the command line.
Useful for machines which require arguments to tell \fIld\fR to increase the
stack space (e.g. the Gould, which uses \*(lq\-m\08\*(rq).
Usually, \*(lq\-s\*(rq is a good choice in any event.

.ti -.5i
ldoptlibs:
.br
Options given directly to \fIld\fR\0(1) (via \fIcc\fR\0) at the end of the
command line.
The two most common are:
\*(lq\-ldbm\*(rq if you're running MMDF with the \fIdbm\fR package;
and, \*(lq\-lndir\*(rq if you are generating \fIMH\fR on a system
which does not load the new directory access mechanism by default
(e.g., 4.1BSD, SYS5).
If you don't have \fIlibndir\fR on your system,
the sources are in \fBmiscellany/libndir/\fR.

.ti -.5i
lex: lex -nt
.br
Alternative version of \fIlex\fR.  Used in \fBzotnet/tws/\fR.

.ti -.5i
sprintf: int
.br
The return value of the \fIsprintf\fR library routine.
This defaults to \*(lqchar\ *\*(rq.  Set this to \*(lqint\*(rq if
you have an older version of SYSTEM 5 which has this routine return an
\*(lqint\*(rq type.

.ti -.5i
sharedlib: off
.br
Makes libmh.a into a shared library (only for SunOS 4.0 and later).  
If you enable this, be sure to use \*(lqoptions SUN40\*(rq.

.ti -.5i
slibdir: /usr/local/lib
.br
The directory where the MH shared library should go.
You'll need to manually run \fIldconfig\fP\0(8) whenever a new
shared object is installed on the system.

If you want to
put it somewhere other than \fB/usr/lib\fP or \fB/usr/local/lib\fP
(not advisable), you'll probably have to run \fIldconfig\fR\0(8) on
that directory, or
alter the environment variable \fBLD_LIBRARY_PATH\fP for each
user wishing to use the MH system (this is messy). See
\fIld\fR\0(1) for more information about how to do this.

.ti -.5i
oldload: off
.br
Support for the ALTOS loader if \*(lqon\*(rq.
Support for loaders not handling `\-x\0\-r' correctly if \*(lqnone\*(rq.

.ti -.5i
ranlib: on
.br
Support for systems with \fIranlib\fR\0(1).
For SYSTEM 5 systems,
this should be \*(lqoff\*(rq which tells \fIMH\fR to use \fIlorder\fR and
\fItsort\fR instead.
Some SYSTEM 5 sites reported that running this isn't always sufficient.
If this is the case,
then you should edit \fBconf/makefiles/uip\fR to include
\fB\&../sbr/libmh.a\fR and \fB../zotnet/libzot.a\fR twice in the LIBES
variable.

.ti -.5i
tma: off
.br
Support for the TTI \fItrusted mail agent\fR (TMA).
Although the TTI TMA is \fBnot\fR in the public domain,
the \fIMH\fR support for the TTI TMA \fBis\fR in the public domain.
You should enable this option only if you are licensed to run the TMA
software
(otherwise, you don't have the software in your \fIMH\fR source tree).
.in -.5i
.PP
Now edit \fBconf/config/mtstailor\fR,
depending on your choice of the setting
for mts in the \fIMH\fR configuration file.
for an mts setting of \*(lqmh\*(rq,
look at the file \fBconf/tailor/mhmts\fR;
for an mts setting of \*(lqsendmail\*(rq, \*(lqsendmail/smtp\*(rq,
\*(lqmmdf/smtp\*(rq, or \*(lqmmdf2/smtp\*(rq,
look at the file \fBconf/tailor/sendmts\fR;
and,
for an mts setting of \*(lqmmdf\*(rq, or  \*(lqmmdf2\*(rq,
look at the file \fBconf/tailor/mmdf\fR.
.PP
Now install the configured files into the source areas.  (On SYSTEM 5
systems you may need to use \*(lqmake sys5\*(rq to compile mhconfig.)
.sp 1
.nf
% make
% ./mhconfig MH
.fi
.PP
You now proceed based on your choice of a transport system
(the setting for mts above).
The best interface is achieved with \*(lqsendmail\*(rq
followed by \*(lqmmdf\*(rq or (\*(lqmmdf2\*(rq),
and then \*(lqmh\*(rq (stand\-alone delivery, not recommended).
.SS SENDMAIL
If you want \fISendMail\fR to transport messages for \fIMH\fR,
then go to the mts/sendmail/ directory.
.sp 1
.nf
% cd ../mts/sendmail/
.fi
.sp 1
This directory contains files whose definitions correspond to the
configuration of your \fISendMail\fR system.
If you have enabled BBoards or POP service,
then you will need to re\-configure \fISendMail\fR.
First, in the \*(lqlocal info\*(rq section of your site's
\fISendMail\fR configuration file,
choose a free macro/class (B is used in this distribution),
and add these lines:
.sp 1
.in +.5i
.nf
# BBoards support
DBbboards
CBbboards
.fi
.in -.5i
.sp 1
Second, immediately after the inclusion of the zerobase file,
in the \*(lqmachine dependent part of ruleset zero\*(rq section,
add these lines:
.sp 1
.in +.5i
.nf
# resolve names for the BBoards system
R$+<@$=B>		$#bboards$@$2$:$1		topic@bboards
.fi
.in -.5i
.sp 1
Be sure to use tabs when separating these fields.
Third, add the line
.sp 1
.in +.5i
.nf
include(bboardsMH.m4)
.fi
.in -.5i
.sp 1
after the line
.sp 1
.in +.5i
.nf
include(localm.m4)
.fi
.in -.5i
.sp 1
in your site's \fISendMail\fR configuration file.
Finally, you should link the file \fBmts/sendmail/bboardsMH.m4\fR into your
\fISendMail\fR cf/ directory and re\-configure \fISendMail\fR.
.PP
If you have enabled POP service,
a similar procedure must be used on the POP service host,
to re\-configure \fISendMail\fR.
First, in the \*(lqlocal info\*(rq section of your site's
\fISendMail\fR configuration file,
choose a free macro/class (P is used in this distribution),
and add these lines:
.sp 1
.in +.5i
.nf
# POP support
DPpop
CPpop
.fi
.in -.5i
.sp 1
Second, immediately after the inclusion of the zerobase file,
in the \*(lqmachine dependent part of ruleset zero\*(rq section,
add these lines:
.sp 1
.in +.5i
.nf
# resolve names for the POP system
R$+<@$=P>		$#pop$@$2$:$1			subscriber@pop
.fi
.in -.5i
.sp 1
Be sure to use tabs when separating these fields.
Third, add the line
.sp 1
.in +.5i
.nf
include(popMH.m4)
.fi
.in -.5i
.sp 1
after the line
.sp 1
.in +.5i
.nf
include(localm.m4)
.fi
.in -.5i
.sp 1
in your site's \fISendMail\fR configuration file.
Finally, you should link the file \fBmts/sendmail/popMH.m4\fR into your
\fISendMail\fR cf/ directory and re\-configure \fISendMail\fR.
.SS MMDF
If you want \fIMMDF\fR to be your transport service,
and have \fBNOT\fR specified \*(lqmmdf/smtp\*(rq (or \*(lqmmdf2/smtp\*(rq)
as your mts setting,
then go to the mmdf/ directory.
(If you're using \*(lqmmdf/smtp\*(rq or \*(lqmmdf2/smtp\*(rq
as your mts setting, then skip to the next section.)
.sp 1
.nf
% cd ../mts/mmdf/
.fi
.sp 1
This directory contains files whose definitions correspond to the
configuration of your \fIMMDF\fR system.
.PP
If you're running \fIMMDF\-I\fR,
then copy the following files from wherever you keep the \fIMMDF\fR sources
to this directory: mmdf/h/ch.h, mmdf/h/conf.h, utildir/conf_util.h,
utildir/ll_log.h, mmdf/h/mmdf.h, utildir/util.h, mmdf/mmdf_lib.a,
and utildir/util_lib.a.
.PP
If you're running \fIMMDF\-II\fR,
then copy the following files from where you keep the \fIMMDF\fR sources
to this directory: h/ch.h, h/conf.h, h/dm.h, h/ll_log.h, h/mmdf.h, h/util.h,
and lib/libmmdf.a
.PP
If you have enabled bboards,
then the directories \fBsupport/bboards/mmdfI\fR
and \fBsupport/bboards/mmdfII\fR
contain information you'll need to
put a UCI BBoards channel in your \fIMMDF\fR configuration.
Similarly, if you have enabled option \*(lqmf\*(rq and are
running \fIMMDF\-I\fR,
then the \fBzotnet/mf/mmdfI/\fR directory contains information you'll need to
put a \fIUUCP\fR channel in your \fIMMDF\-I\fR configuration.
Finally, the directory \fBsupport/pop/mmdfII\fR contains information you'll
need to put a POP channel in your \fIMMDF\-II\fR configuration.
.PP
Note that \fIMMDF\-II\fR is distributed with the BBoards channel,
although the version in the \fIMH\fR distribution might be more current,
the version in the \fIMMDF\-II\fR distribution has been tested with that
revision of \fIMMDF\fR.
.SS MMDF/SMTP
If you are using \*(lqmmdf/smtp\*(rq as your mts setting,
then no further MTS\-specific action is required on your part!
.SS MMDF2/SMTP
If you are using \*(lqmmdf2/smtp\*(rq as your mts setting,
then no futher MTS\-specific action is required on your part!
.SS "STAND\-ALONE DELIVERY"
If, instead, you want \fIMH\fR to handle its own mail delivery,
then no futher MTS\-specific action is required on your part!
.SH GENERATION
Go to the mh.6/ directory and generate the system.
.sp 1
.nf
% cd ../; make
.fi
.PP
This will cause a complete generation of the \fIMH\fR system.
If all goes well, proceed with installation.
If not, complain, as there \*(lqshould be no problems\*(rq at this step.
.SH INSTALLATION
If the directories you chose for the user\-programs and
support\-programs
(\*(lqbin\*(rq and \*(lqetc\*(rq in the \fBconf/MH\fR file)
don't exist,
you should create them at this point.
.PP
\fBBefore proceeding\fP,
you should familiarize yourself with the \fIAdministrator's Guide\fR.
To generate an \fInroff\fR version, go to the doc/ directory
and type:
.sp 1
.nf
% (cd doc/; make ADMIN.doc)
.fi
.sp 1
To generate a \fItroff\fR version, type
.sp 1
.nf
% (cd doc/; make guide)
.fi
.sp 1
instead.
.PP
If you're already running \fIMH\fR at your site,
you should also read the \fImh.6\fR changes documents.
The sources are in \fBpapers/mh6.5/\fR and \fBpapers/mh6.7/\fP.
.PP
Next, if you enabled support for the UCI BBoards facility,
then create a login
called \*(lqbboards\*(rq with the following characteristics:
home directory is \fB/usr/spool/bboards/\fR with mode 755
(actually, use the value for \*(lqbbhome\*(rq given in the \fIMH\fR
configuration file),
login shell is \fB/bin/csh\fR (or \fB/bin/sh\fR),
and, encrypted password field is \*(lq*\*(rq.
The \*(lqbboards\*(rq login should own the \fB/usr/spool/bboards/\fR
directory.
In addition to creating \fB/usr/spool/bboards/\fR,
also create \fB/usr/spool/bboards/etc/\fR
and \fB/usr/spool/bboards/archive/\fR.
These directories should also be owned by the \*(lqbboards\*(rq login.
.PP
If you enabled support for POP,
then on the POP service host,
create a login called \*(lqpop\*(rq with the following characteristics:
home directory is \fB/usr/spool/pop/\fR with mode 755,
login shell is \fB/bin/csh\fR,
and, encrypted password field is \*(lq*\*(rq.
If you don't have \fB/bin/csh\fR on your system (V7),
then \fB/bin/sh\fR is just fine.
The \*(lqpop\*(rq login should own the \fB/usr/spool/pop/\fR directory.
You'll also need to add a line to the \fB/etc/services\fR file and the
\fB/etc/rc.local\fR file,
see the \fIAdministrator's Guide\fR  for more details.
.PP
If this is not the first time you have installed \fIMH\fR,
these files will need particular attention:

.nf
.in +.5i
.ta \w'VeryVeryBigDirectoryName  'u
\fIDirectory\fR	\fIFiles\fR
\*(lqetc/\*(rq	MailAliases, BBoardAliases, mtstailor
/usr/spool/bboards/	BBoards, \&.cshrc, \&.mh\(ruprofile
/usr/spool/bboards/etc/	*
.re
.in -.5i
.fi
.PP
The \fBMailAliases\fR, \fBBBoardAliases\fR, \fBmtstailor\fR and \fBBBoards\fR
files will not be installed over existing copies;
you will need to edit these by
hand and merge in any changes from your previous \fIMH\fR release.
The other files under \fB/usr/spool/bboards/\fR will be overwritten
if they exist.
You may wish to preserve your old versions of these before installing
\fIMH\fR.
.PP
As the super-user, and from the mh.6/ directory, install the system.
.sp 1
.nf
# make inst\-all
.fi
.sp 1
This will cause the \fIMH\fR 
processes and files to be transferred to the appropriate areas
with the appropriate attributes.
.SH TAILORING
See the \fIAdministrator's Guide\fR for information on tailoring \fIMH\fR for
the MTS, BBoards, and POP.
.SH DOCUMENTATION
In addition to this document,
the administrator's guide,
and the user's manual,
there are several documents referenced by the user's manual which may be
useful.
The sources for all of these can be found under the \fBpapers/\fR directory.
.SH "OTHER THINGS"
Consult the directory \fBmiscellany/\fR for the sources to a number of things
which aren't part of the mainstream \fIMH\fR distribution,
but which are still quite useful.
.SH FILES
Too numerous to mention.  Really.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
make(1)
.SH BUGS
The \fImhconfig\fR program should be smarter.
.PP
The Makefiles should know when \fImhconfig\fR has been run and force
\*(lqmake clean\*(rq behavior.
