/*
 * Modification history
 *
 * 29 Jun 88 -- D. Long
 *	Don't use return value from fputs, Ultrix is not SVID
 *	compliant here and returns undefined.  Use ferror instead.
 *	Also do error checking on fprintf's and fclose's.
 * 1 Aug 88 -- D. Long
 *	Fix previous fix.  Don't do a FAILPUT in xrm.

	Routine to write out either the current line in the packet

	A line is actually written (and the x-file is only
	opened) if pkt->p_upd is non-zero.  When the current line from 
	the packet is written, pkt->p_wrttn is set non-zero, and
	further attempts to write it are ignored.  When a line is
	read into the packet, pkt->p_wrttn must be turned off.
