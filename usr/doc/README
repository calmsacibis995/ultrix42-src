This directory contains source for most of the
documents contained in Volume 2 of The UNIX
Programmer's Manual.  Most use -ms to format;
many also use refer, tbl and eqn. Precise incantations
are engraved in ./run.

The citations for those papers that use
refer are taken from /usr/dict/papers/Rv7man.

To save space the files and directories have been combined into a
tar image and compacted using compact.  To retrieve these files use
uncompact to restore the tar image and tar to extract the desired
document. The tar image is 5244 1K blocks in size.  If insufficent disk
space is available for this image ccat can be used to provide a
standard input to tar to get the file(s) that are required.
To obtain a listing of the image the following command can be used.
ccat doc.C | tar tvf -
